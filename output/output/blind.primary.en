yes , good day my talk , my brother .
thank you very much for today , i 'm going to talk about today .
and i 've got to imagine myself now .
my name is sarah remediate , and i 'm a little bit , annually delve , for the city ,
these are called wahlbeamte wahlbeamte for eight years .
and my favorite , i think , first , first sun-like , second , second organization , third , the third thing , the public , right ?
so i 'm interested in the city of this city to do this .
and yet , you do n't worry about the pitching .
i know .
and about it , and this is something which was something that my daughter was particularly , i 'm also feuerwehrdezernent , but i 'm feuerwehrdezernent .
that 's why i 'm a mutates of the essener of dissipate essener .
siebenhundertfünfzig siebenhundertfünfzig and gymnasium fünfhundert .
and so i 've been thinking about it , of course , is an theme that i want to do with parish today .
and i 've been doing with the theme of the field of the field , because it 's also going to talk to the three-fifths that i 've ever been to stop the time .
we hope to best and we 've been looking at the worst thing that was called the term , what 's called the best thing that we 've done .
you know it .
he was even nephites at general electrics , right ?
and i 'm going to do n't let something do so much to say so much too much .
i 'm going to give you a little bit to you can .
so here 's what we 're talking about , if there is a risk that we 're going to be a moment from a disaster , reassure reassure , violating , childish .
many people are all around .
it turns out , it turns out , it turns out there .
and somewhere in a box here , a suitcase , a suitcase , mismatcher , a little bit , but something beklebt , maybe beklebt beklebt with their own .
no one seems to be able to share it .
the treasure does n't know any of the vacuum .
so let me put a durchsage process .
now , let 's go out the bahnhofsgelände .
police police , continuum , blaulicht .
people call up .
adjustments distressed .
go out of the walk out of it .
what is , where , `` hey , passanten passanten . ''
we do n't know that or not to be able to say , `` we ca n't say it . ''
people were coming out the building the system .
children are crying .
some of the meantime may may be because it needs to go and so everything to work everything so much , so you can go to it .
all of a sudden , a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a few years .
there 's giftgas in the middle of the way .
a consequence of capitals , right ?
i 'm going to look at this here .
the rest i 'm going to do the math advice of mind .
but it 's not an explanation that i 've got aufgezählt . hemisphere ?
and that 's exactly what this happened in this week , in this week happens in düsseldorf .
there 's a separate place where they 're going to be here .
so later , once , that doorstep , nine anführungsstrichen , nine dollars of these were polycentric , which was pcb .
but people were just like that , and so a friend of mine , i was told to the exquisitely , which was midst from the building ,
it was n't really told .
and it was that this session before a lot of years at the group that i was going to be the friend of my friend had been published before my friend .
god is no responsibility , because there would be the whole kiki , not so much as million-person as it seems .
you see , in a krisensituation , in a beginnenden disaster , a competition , very important , very important , right now , right now .
communication is important because the people that we can actually go into this situation , to be linked to design , to be sofa , to be carroça .
they want to know what 's going on here .
in the moment , the good time , the time was the case that was really easy for the fact that it was right easy to the end of the government ,
we just had nothing said , or we have a bit of the way , we 've got a bit of mallard , right ?
why ?
because the inwards of the panikmythos has been there .
you 've got to say , `` well , god , people , '' people , say , `` people , '' for people , '' we do n't even want the word or not , we 'll tell the unwahrheit .
this is in a time of social media , in a period of twitter , in a time of facebook , in a time of facebook , in a time of private and public space , in a time of privatem and public and public and not
and so simple and behold , it 's not a moral solution , and the second is probably because we 're going to get the last one as a dwarfed like the center of the tilt that would have been talking about .
you may remember the flugzeugabsturz , in the '60s , it 's a few years ago , already already come back .
the first day about it was about twitter , twitter .
from someone who was on a tornado , and he nineteen grownup , and here 's a plane , and we 'll be people who are now people .
it was n't a behördenkommunikation behördenkommunikation .
you can see , we 're dealing with , today and jb that are from the case , from the truth of the truth and say very aka , very affectionately , very sufi .
because mostly , we are also the last that we 're doing the truth of the data , because as a tacks , of course , as we 're just aware that we only only gesicherte information , which is just mcdonough information .
and what 's public media or even private farmers ca n't just be so very , or they do n't really do it .
so , from that , we 're going to eat in food , and that 's something that has been able to imagine that media , we 're thinking about how we 're doing in the future with katastrophenkommunikation ,
and we 're going to get the good old sirene again again .
but only as a sort of a form of gymnasium ,
this is what we 're going to do is going to be about the last year in the next year , in the hundred years of the panicked that have some of you , you know , are the losheulen , it 's the murden , it 's a cuz , you know , it 's a emeka .
in the way , it was that it was with this .
you may know you guys who talk about what 's going to be a second , a moment , once again and a moment , to you think about it before you 're going to be a moment .
i do n't know it anymore anymore .
we 're going to get all of the same amount of all the way that we 've been working on this , so on , facebook , the word , and the experimentally , and the confuse , and the other media and the most of the most and the most powerful , and then , to get the information to get the
and we know , we have to do it very quickly and umfassend , and we have to take very fast and umfassend , because the bürgerinnen and citizens are going to be verunsichert .
and we do n't even think about what 's what we want to say what we want to say .
so , in the crisis or in the market , in a br , a single question about the other talk about all the media that are us to come and to us , and it 's also a question of little-known .
now , our directing problem , because the bürgerinnen problem and citizens say , they 're governs , it 's not all , or you say , `` it 's all the ninety , it 's all much worse than it is
we 've also made good things with facebook and a short , unfortunately , since we 've got far before .
and also , you may have a few of you in the media , you know , the most famous thing .
we 've had a bigger bombenfund in food , food , too .
and it 's a i’ll that 's called a chemical bomb .
these are five gov that are volvo , because they 're not going to go to the first aufschlag on the hausdach , but by the developing world of the world 's because of the entire reaction , the shove curaçao , who zweit is smithsonian , and then it came to the
the problem is just a lot of these contemplate , never had the deposition and the rodrigo of the other unveil in the same time in food , '' or so many of them .
and there we were from a researcher named who had his own way that he said that it was a emeka , and we were now known as she was a equates , and she was now dreiundvierzig dreiundvierzig , and now , it 's now called the loss of the
since the years , there was many young president , prostheses in the whole stadtgebiet .
we 'll see what we 're still now imagine .
and this inwards must be e.u. , but not become more , but will be 1800s , so you 're going to be honest .
and so we 've been looking at the krayer park and eighty , in a very simple solution , the euthanasia , a humanly , a embodying , the dwarfed ,
and at the point of the history of the city , the whole species on facebook and a doctor , with the der that the entire sprengung sprengung was far over over sechzigtausend follower in a plus-one in the time .
and the media was excited about , mercedes in the background .
we did n't have to start with the table , but they have mitgelesen and 1st , everything about facebok and twitter .
and this whole had a great effect for us , because the users are going to be mid-'80s to the social media , that social media .
just because you have to have a copy of myself , if i 'm going to stop .
i ca n't come from here at the morning .
this is the other thing that because the first of the social media has the advantage that they 're very very important to make a difference in the world .
not so that is n't so very meinungsmache , because the guys have the eagerly or the follower , as you call it called tropics , a high school .
second , early mormon , worked .
if nothing is not something , someone who would be fringes , and the afforded of the silenced i 've been heard , is because it 's the whole community in the possibility of the sense of the
and it 's a very high korrekturgeschwindigkeit , so if something wrong , then it can also be very quickly , so it can be very quickly ,
and we have a huge verbreitungsmenge .
i said , `` sechzigteusend who thought that this was a thing that was a i’ll in the krayer park , '' ] , '' ] kilo .
so , from that , we 've been all of these things that are happening in the last year , and it 's much more important than a manch more than a manch , as a tacks , as a manch , as a manch , which is a case of knowledge knows .
also , the city can be able to look at any more of a dollar a year , so they can go from the city ,
a paper that has been going to be used in a park is not a single thing , it 's not one thing about this .
but they also , and also , we 're going to buddeln , where we 've seen , in the nachbargarten , and then we 're going to yes/no our mrs. and we 're trying to sulfide in seven feet in aufzusprüren .
and when they think about it , think about other cities if they have to be , because they 're going to have a i’ll , you can not be able to detect , but we also have a lot of people who would n't have to look at so
and that 's important , it 's important , because it 's actually going to be in a omg in a world , but to also be able to prevent the responsibility to make it to make it to make it to make it to make sure that people are able to use it to make it to make
and the social media works all about is because they 're all around the communication system , and it 's not just a einseitige einseitige , as we have the chiat , brother-in-law and 1st , at the neuzigerjahren part of the big part .
so , from today , today 's not just a sense of the control of the control , not just a little bit of the embodying or the hilforganisationen , the johanniter , the johanniter , the oceans grow up , but in the thee , and it 's a celine and a apologizing will be all
and magdeburg , that has shown that .
there 's about twitter and a hospitable , who is a lot of the help of the time , when they were still bullseye with the other , because suddenly suddenly have been a 26th of people who are just using any more deiche , and you did n't know all the money that
and this is a lot of a lot of work , also for the public communication in the katastrophenfall , but the electrons have been bullseye with the magdeburgern and the umland , the umland , just the social media from a krisenkommunikation , from a krisenkommunikation , a social crisis , to be more likely to think of
and i hope that i 've taken a little bit of this , that 's actually the most powerful things of life , and it 's boca in the future , and the way that they 're going to do with the
thank you .
so , a beautiful good evening .
i 'm a lot of different ways .
i 'm a writer and regisseurin , as you just heard of it .
and i 'm also now to give a few produktionsfirma to something with a few produktionsfirma .
what it is , i 'm going to make a produzien- , and i 'm going to do something that i 'm going to do you about , so i 'm going to do you .
but before i do that , i need to gather a few things to get a few things .
the first is , i think that we 're helping stories , to make stories to live .
and so we could n't live in my stories without life .
but also , i think there 's a lot of lesenswerte , bandstand , sehenswerte stories , as the natural gas , actually is used to be made of the natural gas .
and then i think that the internet that is clearly deeply , from the way that no , not just like 1800s , stake revive , backgrounds .
and i 'm also , i 'm proposing research that really had been used to be used to be creative , more difficult .
and that they are happier , as soon as they can be creative , as you can do is to be creative .
the more people are going to do , the better thing is about the world .
and so far seriously , right ?
now , these are the better world now is now a critical problem now .
and in the first thing , i was , as i said , `` sorry , who are told you .
and the story i want to tell you is to do is just about petrus in a kneipe , where it 's just happy risd , and i 'm just happy athabasca , who 's just y-axis your birthday .
this is alea .
and it 's aleas aleas transferring , he was domains .
now , they 're going to get rid of the gratulieren and the tweaking does n't work with this moment , because in the moment where it 's been torre , something with something , with something to do something with them .
it happens something in your head , in your body , with your perception of information , with your sense .
and she does n't really words to do for that for it .
they do n't know what happened there , then there 's just happening there .
i 've got to words words for this .
i call this the cuz of oz-effekt .
and you see on the side of the side of a embodying and toto in villager , everything is pretty black and black and black and white ,
i was a 71 , i really kind of a very verrauscht , so i 'm doing a little bit of it .
'tschuldigung .
and on the other hand , we have the two jb in the country with a lot of color , so on the whole bit of color .
and it was at that point of what was that i 'm better inszeniere and writing , as i 'm going to do it for a while .
so , the first thing that is what alea is now with their own perception , is a lapse man with flammend rotem , who she 's very quickly and says , `` all , thank you : so much of your life , your life is over .
this is mikecz .
and mikecz mikecz alea about it , and she has a dodi of a very different kind of people , from a human sense of people .
she was born as a spielerin spielerin .
number of people are who used to give up their einundzwanzigsten to their own life to make their lives .
who are you lightbulbs ?
very beautiful .
imagine the unsterblichen in the zögen , not orleans , when you walk , but it 's spielgeräte from the pocket .
so close , spielkarten , mikadostäbchen , everything else 's mrs. , too much .
what 's important to know is that the player have no choice on their spielzeit .
we do n't know if we die die .
i often mention a long life , but we do n't know it .
it can also be all over time again .
and it 's also about it , my own way too .
you do n't know how to learn how much as you can do , because you can play .
that means , every half a could be the last time , the last time .
a player who have seen his entire life , verlöscht dedicate at the moment of the verlierens of a verlierens like a eighty that 's been ausgeblasen .
now , you can now , of course , if this is so dangerous , why are you still have , then what are they going to do ?
and the answer is that it 's : that 's the thing .
without play , without lapse , a assigning , annually , and only if a player , it 's a player , it 's actually alive alive , it 's actually alive .
they were playing with play play .
so that 's how it works .
this story of alea and how they 're looking at the world of the players , their first challenges , and of course , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in the 44,000
and it 's in a form of a panicked .
the first spring has been 12 12 , sorry , i 'm a zahlendreher zahlendreher that i just started to late late .
so , 12 , in the first steelcase , with a row with a long period of five to seven minutes to seven minutes ,
this kind of re-offend , a model for the other , beautiful unidirektional , you know it , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
the embraces of us for his geburtstunde , nothing else else has nothing else .
this is not new .
and if it was all , then , `` well , '' i 'm first heard , right ? ''
and also , not even at here , not even right here at all .
now there 's just right now .
let 's go back to highlander back to the time , again ,
what 's the most beautiful sentence from the movie or from the laboratory ?
it can only be a person , right .
thank you .
as though we should have been able to do that .
and that is exactly what the power does n't do with my name is not that i 'm going to do .
and there 's very much more , very many , you can have a lot of them .
there are so many different games .
just think about brettspiele , kartenspiele , trinkspiele , strategiespiele and so forth and so forth .
and just as a unzählbar and the number is also the number of augmenting .
and so , there are a lot of stories that everybody wants to tell you .
now the next question : who is that to say that , all this is that all this is that all of it ?
i 've heard a really exciting way that i thought of it .
i 'm interested in hinreichend and very useful , so good , so good .
but i know that a hundred brains are more powerful than just one , even if it 's been a little bit more .
and so it was the right thing to the idea that you can take the crowd , in the creative process of meditated ,
what if we were not just not just dulden or twentieth , whether it 's even more evozieren ?
so when you say , we 're very proud of you , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , a hoo of
so , imagine , in the example , in the three taj , a mikadospieler , which you see hectare , because it 's for example , your emeka version .
they are also a very nice fan of hörspielen hörspielen .
then you can just think with this technology , which is n't more than just about it , it 's not so hard to create a hörspiel , a sevitha , and that 's a hörspiel , and so it 's a hörspiel .
and this microelectronics , she 's going to go on the projektplattform , where it 's right , and that 's the really cool tool that really really ar the audience , which is really mallard .
that is not there , it 's not there , but it 's going to be right right here in where there are the land where it 's going to go there .
and the really beautiful thing is that we 're in the internet , right now .
and in the internet , you can really do everything .
so , a medium is to make sense of a way to do .
it 's what they call is to say , `` do you write , you will be able to do it , and whatever you can do it .
and if we look at this structure at this point .
this is a little bit of maltese from wie'n , right ?
this is what this storynetz is what happens to be built in common .
and i 'm really excited about that the internet was born to tell that this kind of stories that tell you this kind of stories .
it does n't even have a lot of a lot of people , so many of the time , nor the time not , too , not , too , not there , no .
so now , i 'm going to say , `` well , i 'm going to go through , and i will have the audience itself for the choice for the player ,
it 's in a smartphone-spiel in a smartphone-spiel .
and so you can take the wisdom of the panicked , but for people in the real environment that could also have these chk on your cell phone , you know , your own life ,
schlagwörter schlagwörter that you 've all seen , all very , very good , like a suffice and suffice based elements .
these amazing areas that are just going to be very low to the right now .
and i ca n't move on because i would have any more or five years ago .
we 're all right together , we 're all together .
every one of them is to be a serenity here , three parts .
the first part is the webserie , the second part is the user-generated-content part , and then we have the cuz that we have , we 've got the mrs. .
so with this projektplan , i could have the master of the idea of moment , i 've got to get this easy to the lanka : the gründungsinitiative innovation duisburg .
and i had the first price to the first price for the best businessplan .
and i must say , this exoskeleton was fringes from nickel vertretern from loser , additionally , and so on .
so , people are very useful , so , if you should be my own .
and if i can convince you , with my mind : the internet , really big , narrative structures , where we 're going to do about the world , then i think i can actually have to convince every one .
so that 's how it works .
everybody 's got : why is this , is the idea of this is that ?
because it 's because in its own being all used to all of the name of all the areas .
we have the most spielbereich . the thing is that i 'm going to do this , you 're in this , every one time , every one time .
then , we die for the day , the men are going to die .
in the process of the series , there 's a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of a lot of years .
every one thing is , to have , everybody needs to die .
and then of course , every single time is everybody in the sense , when he wants to do this .
this is really completely true . it 's completely important about .
i 'll go out of the theaterbereich , and there 's nothing more than my opinion , when it 's a cuz way of it , so it 's a mitmach-theater .
i do n't know if you know that .
if you 're in the theater and then the initiated swahili in the jungle , all of this , and all god , oh , god , not i 'm not sure i 'm not sure .
and it 's not just to do it .
so it 's hundreds of interaction .
and nobody need to do .
he can also be able to be the audience , it 's just a audience .
the reason i 'm afraid of that is that the whole project is also been in a number of age , first of the moment , right ?
and this has also been a few reasons for a couple of reasons .
i was looking for this project , and i was always going to read it back , and i was asked to say , `` all of the english , they would be bigger , e.u. , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah , blah ,
and i 'm just saying , this is the great büchermarkt büchermarkt , the third century of the world .
the erstgrößte is the english erstgrößte , then the bee comes from , and then the bird you 've got to have a bird , and the vanish .
so it 's not as we 're going to go into a little bit of exited , or in the little bit of it .
and i really also believe that really , if other people are like me , the people who are concerned about something that was not by any more synchronisationsmühlen durchgedreht , where the end of all the citi , and every single glattgebügelt , and every gecko was
if that 's all about how much to do it , then the first reg are now at the first zwölften zwölften , and so forth .
and if you ask yourself why i 'm now , at this point , i 'm now sitting in a tedx-event , where it 's going to be under the embodying transferring worth spreading .
and i 've had a few of this , i 've been asked for some examples .
i love ted-talks .
not only just ted-talks .
i 'm also quite colonel by erfolgsratgebern and still-growing .
a few businessratgeber were also made and villager , businessplanratgeber .
and i really really can say that it 's really important to be incredibly important and incredibly ispirierend .
but it does n't use everything if you do n't take yourself to yourself .
and my project is just so'n , where i 've ever been doing everything i 've learned from so that i 've learned from .
and it 's built in the way .
and so far is now we 're doing right now .
i 'm just saying to say , right ?
so if somebody knows , i 'd just like to make my experience , i had been a thyself , or something that i was able to make a great sense of eighty or whatever , it 's always so
you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , in the internet .
on facebook , it 's a day on facebook .
great , how are we going to talk to the erased of the erased .
yeah , i 'm also find .
let 's go back : can you make memories make sense ?
question : you know , what if you do .
can you make memories ?
can you remember , everything that was going on in your life ?
have you ever get forgotten to forget the dwarfed ?
who has the people who remember ?
it does n't go to the hands , too .
so can you make memories ?
it 's hard to happen .
thank you very much .
no , so we do n't want to do n't talk about anything today .
then the talk would be a very short short , it would be a little bit .
again , good news , my name is samuel peek 's confessed .
the talk today , i heard my mind today because he gave two weeks of my passions or my two great passions from the right here , right ?
i 've got that up in this reclaim , and i 've been looking for me with the roots and bytes , who are going to be so much about the world 's surface to the world .
and seit'ner times time , i 'm also now as budweiser and in private schools and motto area in the field , and so forth , and so forth ,
so , on the side i 've been working on the computer with the computer , where the other side i 'm doing in the same time in the human komponten so'n , so , how does this happen to human human rights ?
how can you change the data ?
and you can take a search for a way to build a scripture .
i was a kazakhstan experiment in a very interesting discussion about artificial intelligence , artificial intelligence .
so , the question was , if we can have a way of thinking , when can we build a computer , which is so how much more than the human brain ?
so , and i think it 's already quite close to close to close to this .
so i 'm doing this two , three years , three times , no longer does it does n't need it anymore .
but let me try and show you why not perhaps a little bit more sense of mistakes .
so the exchange between the computer on the patient , and our brains on the other side .
if we take the computer , then , everything is so , you know , your arm , your wouldn’t , your wouldn’t , your desktop-pc and all these cameras , all all the nt casablanca , and all all the der retrospect in a small whoever , you know , little
he 's called villager , reassure remediate unit .
these are the pieces of a sudden , they 're suu together from winzigkleinen transistors .
the word has already heard of every stage , and in schaltquellen , it will always be so as interactive , as a mammogram .
the ist'n little bit of the annually that has been three calibrate and midst torre or not , or not .
in our computers in our energy , we 've been able to area-denial , nachgeguckt reassure about 10 billion million of these little parts of the small parts .
and the lights are doorstep , right there .
we 're doing things we can recognize things we can hear a word for iss , `` no way to have a computer , we can have a lot of , very much , very quickly , but actually , he 's only a fish , but only that 's a
it 's no way it 's not going to do .
it 's actually quite convenient .
and let 's want to look at our brain with our brain .
our brains have as a tweaking , the neuron , the afforded , and we 've got to be a nachgesaut , more billion billion , so many billion neurons are in our snap mass in our
and this is the wonderful thing that our new thing is not only our new world , not only three connections , but they have to williamson the zwanzigtausend per capita per capita income capital , the neuron ,
and this is a tweaking verbindungszahl of simple , just because it 's beautiful because it 's beautiful , 10 , 10 , right ?
these are 10 with saudis with hintendran deteriorate , risen , right ?
so , you see the complexity of the brain of our brain is that we 've been doing , in fact , we 've already done for a computer , so far .
and if we 're going to take the leistungsverbrauch time , maybe you have one of the world , the first few transfixed that were going to have your own body , meantime the exquisitely , and with the abwärme , and the hawn of the schaltschränke , the plus-one of the schaltschränke ,
our birne raucht sometimes , but the box here is going to be here in about 100 watts of the tree ,
and the reason is that it 's about the same person for two great words , and more of them not , and you can see your calculators there 's wonderful in the middle of the room .
if we now have a little bit more complicated here , so'n eagerly teased retrain , why do we use that , `` why do we forget the point ? so then we then things ?
maybe the one thing is one of the one or any of the informing in the internet , the person will only spend 10 percent of his brain , they 're going to buy them for the mega brain , to be the brain brain .
and ich'glaub there 's a little bit of a gh .
ten percent of the may not , but our brains are now in our species , this is a little bit smaller , the middle of the middle there are still our reptiliengehirn , in the middle of the world has been able to have , motto , things , darumherum others have darumherum .
it 's not going to be because we do n't use this , so we do n't use it .
so why does it seem to think that we have the biggest part of this ?
and you may have you know the term of the unterbewussten of the unterbewussten ?
i 'm talking about that with the sidewalk with the cortex , if you see the taliban , in the sea , then you 're seeing the top , the direction of the bottom line , the bottom is coming from a riesenbrocken ,
and this 10 percent . it 's about what our logischer , our denkender , hintendran , but meds percent is a majora , a euthanasia unterbewusstes , meantime .
we hatten'grad the reshaped of the most 're of the 're of the 're of the 're of the 're of the 're of the 're of the 're of the assigning of the most exacerbate offend dedicate of the most very copulate of the most powerful ways of eighty science .
and to go back to this celsius , and then , nobody knows that one person or others and centigrade people with fotografischem memory .
people who started to be more striking times more than i was n't seen in the situation , and then give the `` i said , `` well , '' but , where do you know ?
that 's because there 's a special one , a lapse , a embodies , a looping , which is a lot of a three-fifths , which is to be domains , and then , what 's been able to do
and that 's not something that 's this way , and here 's , it 's , no , every single house , every single one , every single window , he has seen , he has seen , he 's abgespeichert , he could get back to
where 's the same way where ?
so why , who can not be able to do this , well , the non-stop is that the mensch'n mensch'n would have a little bit more to be more likely to get more likely to get the more percent of their neunzig percent .
now we 're going to do this , but why ca n't i remember at the menükarte night , in all the hands ?
'n 'n hypnotiseur hypnotiseur me to me about me in my own experience of this ,
he had worked for a electrification , and i worked with a vergewaltigungsopfer , which was her own you’ve , which was n't more of the most mallard , the war'ne schutzfunktion of the brain , which is not happening , it 's
wonderful , so that 's been doing well , so that came out .
now , i 'm talking about what people do is doing things to do .
there 's been a very clear period , or at the end , or this next time , even though you could remember the tweaking , you could see the dwarfed of the car that people would be davonfuhren , that was not in a
and actually , in this case , this was a cuz of the wellness of a thyself , which was a little bit about one of the cave .
the second thing i found was great , he has a quote in hypnose who has told her her mother had her first time when she was , she was small , so four years ago .
and then she was sitting on the brits of her mother and her mother had read it .
and then he told her , in trance , ellsey , `` centigrade , '' she would have been , right ? ''
and then she started to get it , she was four times when it was n't even at home time , so you can do this , today , you can do this .
and then she said , he said he said , `` please show me the seitenzahl , '' me , '' and tell me the seitenzahl . ''
they 've also seen a thyself of three trips where the bottom of the side of the text that has been able to read the wife , and that would come up .
so the brain has been this one of how it was abgespeichert , as an image .
and then they could read it .
so yes , we actually have the same thing , but we 're there in the same life , we tell people in the way we 've got to so'ne so'ne schutzfunktion to do n't help us .
now , we 're not looking at the event , but as wir'grad '' he has a single picture , we 're using our sinneseindrücke , so what we 're looking at , what we 're doing is what we 're doing , which is the schon'n , the fibrosis , mid-'80s
and , it was now schon'n long , then you 'll be alle'mal , without insides , füße'n , and then i 'll ask her , you just get , just a little bit , just a little bit of a little bit of eyes ,
and remember , a embodying , a result of a lot of the past few years , yes .
take the first thing that happens .
and if you do it , you may be aware that you could get a sense of this memory in a memory , right ?
you may have a chance to have a picture , perhaps even a movie ?
some of the things that do n't really do it , because we do n't take it so much more , but that 's what they 're doing to first , the first time , which is the first time .
and if you see that , it may be that you 're either in the movie , out of your eyes , or how you look at yourself in a screen , you 're looking at a screen .
we call this one of the inwards , the other person , the other dissoziativ .
thank you so much to solve the idea of the way , let 's take your eyes back again .
who has a certain information , the hand ? come to the end of it ?
yes , so , again , a ira , a few hands , it 's like this famous story , i think , which is about what i 'm concerned , it 's actually something we do , but we do n't do it that it 's not going to do
well , go to 'ma .
so what 's more powerful in the tools , when they do n't hochholen , this is n't quite a sense of obscura , sondern'n entsprechendes , and i 'm seeing a positive event , but it 's all the way to do it , and that 's why
and now what happens is interesting .
'des was much , well , which means the brain does n't really difference and what we actually actually realized , and what we just got to understand what we 're doing , we can do .
and so you can do that , if you look at the time you go home and mid-east something in the future , which is not happening , you will be able to change how information that something you have to know how she was to know what happened in something that was in the last
and , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , like you 're hectares so on geselliger , from this
in fact , hey , this is that , and that was so beautiful , and the more of the stories , the more , the more likely become more , the most participated , including , people were much more , but the strategically still
if we do this , so if we do this , we do n't think our memories can be so much , why do n't we do this , not a question , what do i ask you ?
ich'hab , when i came up , my uncle is a picture of a photo , from his 40s in switzerland , and attentiveness ,
a very beautiful picture , it 's also a very nice optimist .
just a tweaking , noch'n transferring little than the tsunami , so it 's an freedom , he told me , but there 's the noch'n , there 's a little dog , there 's a picture of the tsunami , that 's actually not a sevitha of
and why do n't we do with our own thoughts , our own memories , who knows what i feel like , even if i do some good more , what i mean ? what i mean ?
they actually have a foundation that 's been inspired by their own thoughts .
so , villeicht , they all know that some people you see , when you see if you see the morning , if you just have a celsius eyes , what is it going on ?
i did n't eat a little bit , i had the whole nacht'was nacht'was through the head , and i was going to go through the head .
and i really worked out all the night and this thought i did n't get more to me .
i think it was the way he did n't come out of thinking about the thought he would n't go from saying ,
the son 's friend 's friend of my war'n , when he came home , because his mother had been insides in his 20s , and he was just made it very cool to him .
what 's going to be the father , so he had seen his ted with his son , and he said , or how could you really work the thing that was happening in today ?
what was the most famous , tell you , and then he has to tell him to tell him epitome him , he made him just what he happened , what 's happened to be great , which is why a great deal today .
and , in two years , two weeks , it was the son of the son , he was coming out of the son ,
and then it was also the fact that the mami is gone , and then come back to it again , and then it goes back to it .
and what 's happening is that the whole natural development has done with the world , which is one of the most people that i know .
so it 's not the memories that are ourselves in the way we are , but it 's our focus on our understanding of what we 're doing , we do .
and what 's energy we need to do or more than to do with , or do we do with this ,
so if you 're abends'mal abends'mal , `` oh , this was a yielding , that 's a ne , but it 's not a little bit of epitome , you know , burdens sie'grad , you know , des'is
what 's like the word we 're doing , `` well , what 's a nice , `` guck , vibrational , `` well , guck , `` well , that 's made me heut , '' which means that , you know , that was beautiful , so
and then imagine that , right now .
take this out in your unterbewusstes and let 's put it the world 's ira .
or if you read somebody 's defuse , ne , it 's your jezt your experimentally , or your wife , or your husband , five-digit her 'tschuldigung , 'tschuldigung , they 're doch'mal'drüber .
so , take a picture of it , they put it demjenigen'n somali , '' he said yes .
so'ne so'ne gauklerkappe gauklerkappe , they all-out it in the experimentally teacher , they 're laughing wrong , why do you know what 's wrong ?
because they 're thinking because it 's because because of this idea is funny , it 's funny , it 's fun , right ?
and they can much much better with the situation of the situation , so you can get rid of a little bit of time .
so why is the crowd of nickel ?
no , i think our brain has so much as much , that it can be all around it all the way it can be done anything .
it 's nothing wrong because we can prevent free , how much of us , and how we 're going to be a way of a sense , a memory , a thought , a sense , it comes from us , it comes from us .
my talk about them , you 're playing with the images in your head , you use the power of your indicated , and give you every day , they give him every day , which are your life that lives your life
yes , good afternoon .
thank you for listening to me .
if i 'm going to ask me in a party , what i 'm doing in my body and tell me that i 'm going to play with a musikfestival organisiere and rielly , then i see commune , and in the most beautiful usa-land , brittle , zeltstädten and schlammschlachten , schlammschlachten
and when i think it 's a i’ll for a music of romantic music , then it 's deflect in this tanzenden menschenmassen of the people who are in sings , long time , in sings , and very proliferate , art ,
frank zappa said once , for me to talk about music is so popular about architecture .
and so , as a similar thing that looks like with what we do .
so , what you do is , i 'm going to do is going to talk to a view , i 'm going to talk about , i 've got a little movie on my film .
film .
greenpeace is obviously doorstep rock'n'roll about it . it 's been doing it .
it 's going to be bullseye from the best possible thing to happen to me .
since zweitausendneun zweitausendneun is the podiumfestival from the unbedingten , which is to make something something different , and do something .
we 're looking at the world 's thee and middle , and over the end of five days , and i 've been found in early youth , which incredible incredible power and joy the music is mitbringt .
but we also have that , the teased of the kulturbetriebs and the klassikmarktes of us , we would tell us some joy , good , a little bit of a little bit of a little bit .
and we 're also surprised the teased of the captain of the classical music for the power , the right of the music itself , but in its darstellungsform , is at their darstellungsform .
so , let 's ask the question we can make a konzerterlebnis that the music is that the friends and the power again , which we can do it with very , we want to do so much like them .
how can we take a klassikfestival , which will end off the declan of the kulturbetriebs of the kulturbetriebs of the kulturbetriebs of the dwarfed of the charted ?
we take the fates that you know , the non-stop reflex , the time , time , space , in the context is in question .
let 's take the example of the relationship between the 2nd and well-being .
usually , there 's between the stage and the sun 's a walter .
we 're trying to make a combination of a way of view .
here 's an image of our jam-konzerten , so our jam-konzerten .
the inward of the tweaking , the originated , they 're going to work on the baron , brahimi , and play , two pieces , they 're going to be in the audience .
the whole thing that will happen to be a little bit of the time in the time , a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of time ,
everybody who has come out of mitzuspielen , comes back to the stage and come back .
or this is where you 're sitting in the concert .
now , in copenhagen , it 's a little bit of you as much more or less time , always common-sense , as fast as you see here and you look at the watch and see the back and see the back and you see .
but it 's music , there 's actually not going to be able to sit down again .
and we 've done the idea of how to be able to do this .
if you 're doing it all over and you can go to a rhythmischen piece of music , then hear them out to anything else .
now , for example , this is that we did n't have a cuz , but four four meals to the most bercken .
the audience could have mitdrehen , yearly , yes ,
so the ted conference was all in the first few times , the first few years .
so important for us is that we do n't only do just do any more likely to do , but that we are from the music , from the music .
so what we 're going to ask us , which are the common connections and atmosphären , but what is the same way of the people have the music they 're so able to do so how to you like to be able to get it ?
and so , in the informing , mercedes doomed zweiundzwanzig in kirchengebäuden , who has been just about governs kerzenlicht , in obscura , in industriebrachen , in industriebrachen , in obscura , in old weinkellern , in old contemplate .
but not only do the bacteria and the bees can be music and parish , but also the connection with other people , and so forth , and so forth , and so forth , and so forth , and so forth .
and so we 're very happy that we were working for a few years ago , and we 've been working on the bundesjugendballet that we 've been done to us or gl to music , which is actually called `` aida '' was called the embodying . ''
and so they 're going to be choreographien for fringes and kilo for steve families , who are n't mallard , or so many other words .
and in this year , we 've got us , we 're going to make it , kindheitstraum , it 's kindheitstraum .
we 've been a first time with a first bouba with a animationsfilm-team animationsfilm-team , which is a assigning , which is the first thing to do .
we 've been the story of the tweaking of igor with starry , mockup , rielly and susie animationsfilm to a gesamtkunstwerk risd .
so , it 's also true of the way that because we had a big internet-community , which we 've had a big deal with us to this piece of this piece of this piece of chill .
we 've been looking at a much more crowd-funding-kampagne of money from the united states , so we could use the umsetzten that we could do that .
so , in fact , this gentleman , something called what a place is a michal , is a sevitha , which is happening .
we 're very happy in lange to have a thyself in the middle of the city , a half , and we 've seen in a home ,
the city is so that we 've been great , we 're great leone and creativity places for heh , but also , so that it was so small that we 're going to be safe .
when the year is the first year in the year , in two years , two weeks , spitzenmusiker was in the city , it just does that are going to be able to have more important than more immerse with more important than chill .
all the inwards called gratifying ehrenamtlich .
we 're looking at a thee of the inwards of students and students , religious , literaturwissenschaftler , musik- , medientechnik , medientechnik , really completely completely completely e.u. the real way .
and it 's a tweaking leitungsteam , which is the declan or characterizes and common-sense in my eye , seven underpinning 10 , a noting in a kernteam , a year for a he’s long time .
also , i think it 's also ehrenamtlich , but it 's a little bit about this , for example , the declan of the experimentally or the künstlerbetreuung that quotations veranstaltungtechnik in the hands are gone and 15th to the hawn , and the dwarfed ,
we 're all going to do this in our body and live in a tweaking alone .
so the key part of the work is to yes/no and they 're on a miley , and on a internetplattform , a sevitha .
only three times in the year , we 've been looking at a year , outset , a little bit of other problems that are coming back , and it also also the ability to communicate that the matter of things that you are really important ,
now , for the food self , get to 100 percent of the experimentally of the time to make a few days or a few weeks , and they can be able to help them out , writings , in ticketverkaufen , to ticketverkaufen , in the same ,
and of course , in these days days , these days days , the experimentally come to come to the additionally to do it .
now you could do so , you could have anything that you need to do a declan , which you need to be a 96 .
but our macherkreis is still going to be further .
we 've been in esslingen in the city of a new community around us to start to us , where we 're going to be able to be able to do what we want to do .
but this is the non-stop of the sponsoring , but it 's also about things like this , as much as the anne , we have a suffice , which we 're using our own aushilft or a biomarkt that we have been able to have access to the food that we can have access to
the ticketing is going to be in a buchhandlung in the city in the city there , and it 's made , and have been remotion .
until it was to go to the probemöglichkeiten .
we 've been building a whole range of local media that allow us to take our living room to go to the exquisitely that we can get to hart , and then the discharged of the courts .
and then , this kind of , and the inwards is made a little bit of a little bit of a place to this city and from people in this city , which is , in the city .
they 're moving into a very special kind of way that we 've been able to call this gentleman , right now , right ?
since we had been remotion , we could use großzügiger support from the 105 of the living room , which is now the whole trend on a zukunftsfähige , and motto youngster , and mid-'80s casablanca .
we 're looking at the pitching that we believe that dog music , you squeeze it into the right hands , right ?
so we 're incredibly excited about that in the past few young contemplate musicians music in their own hand and home in the cities , in the cities , in the cities , in the cities ,
if you ca n't even find out of how to feel a music , music music is then , you 're going to get out of it , then you get over .
so next year we were looking at boca , and we would look at it , if we are also there , then they 're there .
yes , my brother and gentlemen , learning , learn .
you might think of mind in your mind .
knowledge of thinking or for the effect of learning , but i mean , for example , a lot more , more important , very composing ren rungen and 15th the food .
knowledge of my experience , a beautiful portrait for the lebensgestaltung .
what i learned from art and culture , now , i can say a lot of questions , because in corp bit , i 'm in this field , i 'm in this field , and i 'm in this field .
and so i think that that might be true to this very little vanish to another person to give another thing to what is talking about what my talk of a swings .
art is beautiful , but it 's a lot of work , too work .
they 've also been able to give them all the time .
you always always the statistics , though most of the reaction , you know , the term , you know , the tacks .
so why is that ?
i think this is to do that , because in the word of something bad , what we ca n't really be able to do this right , right ?
art , we say , sometimes we can , which is what 's what 's going on .
we 're going to do that , which means that what it has done .
sometimes sometimes too .
the people who like to work , which has been what i 'm doing is to me .
but in the way , we think about the alltagswelt and the art for the rich of the way that we 're going to move around , our experiences , our challenges thought , our own thought .
and so i 've been doing this lebensweg , which i want to show you now , about about 20 hours in five contemplate , which are all the title , and i start to make it for them , because it 's a
it starts with the invention , for the childhood , for the inspiration , for my youth , i 'm not going to tell us all of my youth , not a little bit , and then the word initiation , i 'll tell me why i 've been doing
the work for the first part of my life and my first life , and finally , steepness , a little bit about it .
now , one of them is to you have these guys will have these calcutta of johann half-mile .
inventionen , one and a half , dreistimmige and dreistimmige .
you learn it in the first two years , three years , if you 're fired , and i 've got to give you a little bit about it .
and so with 10 , 11 , i 've been hectares these little pieces , on the checklist , not far from here , at the kreuzeskirche , home .
these pieces of life in a kontrapunkt , a kontrapunkt .
there 's a community and a little voice , but it 's very different .
the bee is right , but it 's gegeneinandergesetzt .
and that , ladies and gentlemen , something is entscheidendes on the art that it 's been , and if it 's only two voices , gegensätzliches jobs , if the world 's time , in the way , the world 's confessed , in the way , the
and i learned from two raced , sometimes sometimes three dreistimmigen , to the same time , but to remember that , that the der that the der that did n't want to do something that does n't do the other .
so that 's what i learned from each other .
another experience , i never remember the strategically , and i 've had to do that i might think of the reason that i could n't even get to you can get to look at it so much .
i 've been safest reassemble , there were more people in the room today , and in the middle , i was going to be made out of the appachan .
i was worried that the end of it .
i 've got a augmenting .
so again , again and looked at the same thing i did n't go back again .
the audience is almost more than i was , because i went to all of the room on my pocket , my brother , they looked at , and then the third time , and the third time of the
and they do n't believe what the bins has been athabasca me .
but it was a very difficult experience .
maybe it was a lot of the way , i knew that , well , with myself , until i had a little bit of , i would n't have been y-axis , i could n't go to my berufsweg , because of course , you 're going to talk to butler up .
yes , the next three of my jugendzeit , i 've been able to work with inspiration and myself , and i 'm going to tell you what i 'm going to tell you stories , i 'm happy to tell stories .
and when i was so sechzehn , i went to my klavierlehrer , and i said to him , `` oh , no words , i 'd like to play a cuz game , and i want to play a chopin-walzer game .
and he said , craig , that 's not .
you have to have a lot of kaffeehäuser , and you 've got to have a lot of kaffeehäuser and very much experience with women with women , and women have been e.u. .
now imagine a celsius young man , so , a young woman , so a sentence .
i did n't forget that , of course , forget that the war .
and from there i 've been able to give a more more , more than i 've been more concerned ,
in addition , i was to go to the time , and to be in a kaffeehaus , a thyself , a while .
i 've got a embodying , and i remember that i had never been able to have done this , i would n't have been weakest .
it was the scherzo of b-moll from the pitching , and now i 'm going to do that , i 'm not going to do a position of the pitching , and she was with the most beautiful , and yet , you 've got the most beautiful , you 've had to get the poor , and then you get back and over and
i ca n't do it at all , it 's not a little bit , not a piano here , and i could n't have no longer more , more , but it could n't work there .
i 've been this next village , 25,000 times more than a characterizes , and suddenly , she came up right now .
and then i went to go up and nickel , i was in a ekstase , and i do n't know i 've been able to show me all the way back to the ground and comparative .
i was n't even myself .
i did n't have a young , no , and the music has been doing this with me , which is what i was doing .
a experience i 've learned , is also really aware , really emotions are really zuzulassen .
and sometimes it 's also to work for work that you can go into these trancezustand hineinkommt , in this state , i call it the tacks .
where everything goes away .
we actually had this sense of ways of heh in a organization , a declan organization .
and then it was almost all of the way we even have the abschlussveranstaltung , it 's only only two and a few months to where you would have been going to have been to have been a year for a year for something .
now , these were my experiences with the piano with autism , with some work , working to work with work .
and i 'm going to come to my favorite , strata , risen .
i was first , as i was known as a musician , but the mcclure was a hobbymusiker , as well ,
we 've got quartett , 1st , klavierquartett .
i 've been klavierunterricht , and i 've been working on this out of my electrification for the music for music and the chiat , and the gemeinschaftserlebnis was done .
in washington , together , a maui , a h-moll-messe , wonderful experiences that i was very , very much , very mallard , with a lot of ottoman .
and then i came up to the point where i was as jurastudent in the essener theater , and the wield was in the dramaturgie , and the afforded , and i was doing this with a überschrieben , because this guy 's tilt , and i was actually neunzehnhundertachzig , and i was actually neunzehnhundertachzig , and
so the math is the culture to make a job to do with my leitmotiv , to do with my leitmotiv .
so here , the art work , but not as artists , but not , you ca n't say to say , `` but as a kulturarbeiter kulturarbeiter , and as a kulturarbeiter , and you do something to do something .
i was in the theater , and i 've been bullseye , and there 's no longer studiengang for kulturmanagement , particularly , for example , and i 've been working on this question , what are the der to make the cuz to make a
and that was why i was also not even in my research , in my life , in the way , i was looking at this berufes , and contemporaries , i was extinctions , i was kulturdezernent , i was kulturdezernent .
but it was a little bit more broadly , and this panel , and this panel , i 've been überschrieben überschrieben with interaction with it , so , what is it with solutions .
and i was neunzehnhundertsechsundachtzig , i came to the germans of they’ll ,
the german städtetag has its unsure städtetag in köln .
i 'm ruhri , despite me , i 've been in my wouldn’t , because i was born in köln , always , the kölner of scheytt , disincentive me , i have to actually get the der , i need to get that sort of ausmerzen
but i 've got a rheinische game , because my mother had been bullseye , kölner , and there , in the exquisitely , i 've been foreseeable , i 've been the karneval karneval .
it was really about something that i did n't work so much , and suddenly i was in a relationship of culture , a new kind of a volkskultur , in a culture that has been made of people in this
as soon as we karneval in our mrs. , all of them in a very simple situation , in very different ways , in the other people ,
and i 've been fringes with nickel , who was the transforms and justizminister nordrhein-westfalens , who was my friend and robert , and so , since we did n't have the swings music for the plotting , he 's a transforms , i 'm going to densely , another
we 've done the wildecker herzbuben , so of course , of course , but of course , in the hawn of the städtetages , incubators , before sandbox , pasteurii ,
and this karneval , which was really made from the people , which is called the people from the people .
it was my fate that i was commissioned in canopies jones , my research to my doktorprüfung , and i did n't really kriegte that the wall ever was that the wall was made .
i was the next day , i had mündliche mündliche , oh , the wall is so , yes .
i 've been working on that easy to make a good thing to ask for a good questions for grundgesetz ,
and after that , i was beauftragter , i was beauftragter for the cities in the ddr , where i was going to go to the ddr .
and there i 've been looking at how to use how things like carpenter between two famous cultures .
in fact , we 're going to do the same language that the music is still wonderful , and i 've been a little bit , but a lot of rielly , nt , umgedeutet .
so , as a result of the karneval , it was not all of people all the people , but it was a lot of the water , and that 's a kind of a sally , and the celsius , here , like the old identity , i 'm still going back to the embodying , and then
since germany was germany , kulturstaat .
since then , in addition , there 's a lot more bundesebene , more complex gas .
but i also started thinking of all over this stuff here , and all of things , and in , in the city , in the city , right now .
we 've been made by the tweaking that i had been a cuz , imagine it here , i started here , neunzehnhundertdreiundneunzig , holiness , i 'm in heats visitenkarte , dezernent , and i 'm going to do , and all of the
i 've also been doing it even more .
and the embodying was for gruga-park , you did n't want to write about dezernent and culture of grugapark , stripped .
i was the first dislike of the gruga-parks , which is the bulbs .
so i did n't have so much more than that , was the wonderful thing that i was able to do this , but it was soon , because i was going to be a new thing to get to open to open , and then able to do the tacks and twentieth ,
we 've done a lot of the political system , we have the first time , which you 're going to see this pendant between lichtburg , volkshochschule and münster , and what we 've been able to do , the kulturpfad , little-known , where you can see between the world 's
many , many of these interactions , we could have been , and i could have been bullseye and i 've been asked , and what i realized , when it means when we 're going to do , if other people think of different parts of different parts together , together , the goal is a goal together .
you know , you 're still guessing that i 'm going to be more wegkomme of art , and more of us that we can do is that people 's relationship between the future between the world , between cultures , and developing countries , and i 'm going to go back to the art , and i 'm going to go back to the art ,
so , the interaction is then the yes/no of the way we have , obsessional , seven dezernenten , the idea of the immorality , the ruhrgebiet could be midst to the kulturhauptstadt east .
but this last chapter , this guy 's still have the abortion challenged .
this word , two reasons , for one of the time , i 'm going to do me , i 'm going to do something with something , and i can do as a lapse , and say , `` i 'm a little bit , which is what i mean , i mean , i know something , i know something
and it 's always in his eigenheiten .
i know something that with his eigenheiten , so i say i 'm going to give you or or whether or the community , you know , the community .
and i 'm preparing to something that if i 'm going to do , i 'm going to do , and say , `` oh , this is to me , i want to figure out to me with the way i would love to do with .
and that was a very big big action .
five people are going to try and move to millions of people , to move the dreiundfünfzig cities to identify the wouldn’t , to see , and sure that you 're a community is in europe .
as a big thing , we 've got a metropole called but but as a community of many people who are in a large ballungsraum , but at least a salting language , and that 's our scientific to the people , and of course , the whole thing they 're often
in bulgaria , at the sperrung , the sperrung of many , many other visions .
a experience of the kulturhauptstadt did n't have a lot of people that we were in so many people ,
there 's clitoris nischni and food , two schools , a young girl , from the mädchengymnasium , and young students in a deutschsprachigen school , who was young people who were topology , including women , who , shares the first
and it was a very clear that that young girl who had michael 1940 männnern and young vista , including the dwarfed of young men in china , in germany , in a gebrochenem , in a gebrochenem , a little equates ,
and there was one of these young men in the young men and common-sense this muslim-majority that i loved it .
and then he said , he finds a letter and said , `` i 'm pianist , he wrote him home , '' as a young boy , '' he said , `` i ca n't have a more chopin-walzer games , because my two
and he umwickelte his fingers with a mullbinde , put it down to the dwarfed in this game , and i tried to play the chopin-walzer chopin-walzer game .
and it did n't know him .
it was so for me , for me , a anrührende piece that i was going to be insides , was , what are we learned to learn from ?
we 've learned that in the kulturhauptstadt that many people can build a lot , but before all of us , we 've been sechzig for the most squint in our own life , and we can think about our own , because we 're going to make us to make us to make us to make us
and that was an interesting experience , and you see , it 's not just going to learn to do something that 's about something to know something about .
it 's always learning to learn something to understand something and urteilskraft urteilskraft .
and if we do much , and we noticed it , we have to think we 're going to make ourselves to art and culture , to our own position , and when we start to work with our own identity , and we 've all experienced our art
and i hope they 've been a lot of kunst- and nickel kulturerlebnisse , which you 're going to get that one , because you 're going to get this risk of it .
thank you very much .
yeah , thank you very much .
i think we 're going to wait to the first picture .
so i 've been able to meim my own dissipate , my own aka here in the time , here are sufi , so many of the eagerly .
it 's not a scientific slides , but it 's in my speak here , and i 'm going to find a kind of a way i 've been doing , and i think that 's going to be able to get it the next year and so forth ,
through the words , i heard that finally , thank you very much to say , and i think we have in the area of the flared , we can just take this talk about that we 're just going to be a talk to come from .
and then i heard about that , if you should be going to talk to the talk in english , if you look at it , then you would n't understand what i wanted to say in english , i did n't tell you in the moment , i did n't think about it , and so i 've been
how we 're going to die of us .
i have to tell you about this in my talk about rosalinde .
rosalinde was a patient in the hospital , where i was the nt röntgenabteilung , and was the hoo , and i was the kenneth ,
she was about governs years old , and she likes to generalize because they realized that their husband , who was the first man who had the first man who was in the war ,
and so they went every year at the first time , and they 've been a little bit of a long , and then a concluding bowle to work , and then it is , and here is on the right , you see the
a few years before , they were already now , and it was working on the same way , with a very simple , it looked at the left leg ,
and then i was there as a tweaking , and i was talking about her in the originated , where she was treated with africa , and i had the discussion , how did n't really help me , right ?
does it be hard to think of this very more people to make this very much more important to take this to be able to use this value ?
so , cone , rediscovery , in sings , is this a human being zuzumuten ?
and it was a huge thing , and she was e.u. .
five years later , i look at the hospital , and the name of the rosalinde , and i can tell me because it 's so spectacular that 's actually been purchaser , it 's also been working for the time , and it 's got rid of the
so the question is that question , what would i actually come to me if i think about how much human beings , if people do it to be in his patientenverfügung , or what he could have to vorsorgevollmachten ausfüllt ?
and that 's a little bit of the theme of the vortrages .
and you can see the yes/no of the term , we will die , as we 're going to die .
it 's a book from rotates , as we 're going to work , a report on the club-of-rome . ''
and then , it was that the fact that the international very overloaded was so that , what might ask , how can it be more complicated ?
you 've got , and you can also do this in this book today , it says , it will be a shift to the wurman , so the parts are always ied .
it 's going to be a tossing of work , it 's also going to be much more than more than more than more than more than to be the city , and then , in fact , that was a big subject , that 's a big subject .
and that 's also that the work of the individual , so , a 1,034 , something that was less gewertet , he was still using more susceptible to be the mrs. that he 's abliefert , from which it 's
and that , after my feelings , people would always be less mallard from their work and still had a more räderwerkes , where it was about pistols , and not more about how to do
and if we 're doing this in the pflege- and medical space , then there 's a very important thing as a transformation , it 's a change .
if you hear about it , the doctors , the experimentally and the most congested , most of the most meditated , it 's the bulbs called dokumentationspflichten .
and it does n't matter what it has to be used to be what it has done is to be bullseye , and if it 's not about in the case , the tacks , is to do that , you know , to do that , you could not change them to
and through this encrypted , the work of the pflegenden of the pflegenden , more and more , the more important thing that you can do is work on and bacchanal , from the medical care , in the dwarfed , in the dwarfed , disincentive and disincentive , and gallon .
now , a good friend of mine is to remember , because he did n't want to do this , which had had a allgemeinärztliche for the tacks , which was a amidst , and i was going to be a grammy for rotates doctor to altersgebrechen doctor for altersgebrechen .
the holländer are about this , at least , in a reshaped , and he said , who has been that there are more old people from the pflegeheim of the pflegeheim , california , back and back , because the altenpflege did n't know what they were doing ,
then come to the hospital , you get back to the back , go back to the morning , or pflegeheim , and you will go out there and then move around .
and this hausarzt has been thinking about this if there 's so much in the blogosphere , i want to play a mongolia , to get something to tell you that this is what you can do is that you can take out of this whoever of the unglaubwürdigkeit of the unglaubwürdigkeit of the unglaubwürdigkeit and the most
now , in 1997 , he had to come up after that he had learned by language , that it was in the same way that it was exactly the same thing that was happening in this wie-wir-arbeiten-werden .
it 's also going to die , and then , it 's going to die , a thousand people , and it 's also a matter of people ,
it 's not the other people who are doorstep , but you 're actually suu in a way , i 'm going to be a thyself or not in the hospital , if i 'm in the hospital , if i 'm in the
and then the non-stop is going to be going to be going to be fateful .
in 1962 , it 's so much , a third days , a conversation is a conversation with the aufgenommenen , and that you have to do , you know , you want to get a street , or i do n't want to go to the hospital , if i happened .
right ? so i want to be fringes , or i do n't want to be e.u. .
this data is then a assigning , and this video is himalayas , altersgebrechen , the discharged has been bullseye and then the decision does n't come up with this force on this , and then that 's a decision on this , and you will see .
now , when we were working on rosalinde , who were like to be able to go to the food and even once , and imagine , who we had to have a patientenverfügung , but i do n't want to francisco this , and then they could come out of them , and then , not
and the coalesce of my friend now who 's in watershed , it 's very much more novelist how he wants to be doing it with it .
and last year is , today 's about doorstep to 70 percent of people who are not going to be more likely to eat , but in africa , and that silenced pflegeeinrichtungen are boca , and so that 's what we 're doing a lot of people , and it 's not going to be mid-'80s , and
there are ample doomed that are very good people , which is very much people who are in the time , but if i 'm going to look at the gesamtbilanz , and we have about the thousands of thousands of years , so that would be a little bit more , and i think it 's a little bit of
the whole thing that we 've been doing is very important for this , the very important is that these are the tools for the technology is so important because of the people who are not going to be able to be able to do , and that 's the people who are going to be able to do , and that 's a few people who are
it 's just not true , but you need two copulate in the pflege- and altenpflegebereich , and it 's also a very difficult , it 's only only for the fact that it 's just not only .
so this visualization of the yes/no , a cuz of the people that you want to regulate , it is also based on the individual properties .
and now i can show you how to do , so what we 're doing now in the last , because i 've heard about questions , and that 's what is just so simple , so simple , that 's just the situation for
and i 'm just doing the grundgesetz hervorgekramt , and the article of this thing that i think , a society needs to do so much , it 's a structure of the way that we have all the festmachen , which is what we have in our society .
and in the grundgesetz article that one is , which would be the unantastbar people 's slid .
and the second thing there is to be able to protect them to the annually of all the staatsorgane .
and what i 'm sometimes not a big sentence in there , is that there was a single thing to have the value of his own , and then they could have its own and ensuing .
because this is a way to take yourself from the oven , i 'm going to make this way to other and that 's going to work out and villager and then i do n't want to do n't want to do n't talk about a good thing about how i 'm going to die .
because the last one is , unless we do n't want to take this talk about this , we 'll come back to the point .
hopefully , i 'm late at mit , or a hundred or hundertzehn .
now , this is why not to do , i want to say , `` i want to get any sense , but i have to get the idea of it , and if it 's so much more likely to be in the life , or fünfundneunzig , '' or in the way , for example , i want to think about
now , what if you think about it , what 's my best thing , you will come up here , where are the last day , what 's the most important thing in my right ?
there 's now a book , which is pretty hectares vogue , which is a tweaking .
it 's the biases of these , there are the friends that i 've been able to talk to talk to you and i can ask me to know and who love me with the life , and it 's the familienangehörigen .
it 's certainly the trust between people i 've been able to do , in the pflegebereich or the ärztlichen city or a ball or a human one , or other people i 've been able to do in society .
and there are so many of the other people that are there , fingerprint , i do n't all be able to do n't even be able to do n't .
but if you look at these three points of you , you 've got a whole lot of ways of how you have to get in the life for a life that you have to have to get to bm your last kids , the first has to do its own own .
and then there 's another part that we 're going to have a certain you’ve of the most mutates , i 've seen this one bit of text or as a minute for example .
other people can do this for us and this behavior , what sandbox behavior , not , not , not , to do it , not to do it .
that 's my peak .
and then we would only be able to come out of ourselves .
so it 's not the question of what 's going to do , for the people who are going to be able to convince myself , or even for me , who 's myself to me , who are going to do i deal with me ?
it 's also the same thing to ask , where can i get to people , where i can make me and i had to be my own way that i can use with these questions can be able to do this and so forth and
and if you say , what we 're going to be working on , these are these protocells that we 've been looking for the outside , it 's a possibility to say , my definiere would have been my own , i would have been my own
because no person can me , i can feel like i can watch myself and see how to make sense , they would go through and udaipur .
and i do n't have to be heh in general stimmungslagen or understanding that you have to give you a patientenverfügung , because you 're so old , you 're very excited to you , whether you want to be able to do , whether you want to be able to do
these questions that i can actually do was just a long time , i would n't have been sargasso in a last bit of meditated .
this would be a hoo that 's been in me , and it ca n't be able to protect the outside , which is the non-stop of the state , but also , i can also have a lot more people who are able to have a lot more people who are able to have a lot more , so i 've been able to know what i
and to get these things , it needs to grow , and there 's why i 've been so much about this talk , and here 's what 's a lot of stuff that 's like to be able to eat the kreuzeskirchenviertel , but that 's not a lot of things , but that 's not a conversation there
so we 're going to do when we 're old , and we say , well , no , this is a dance , despite all , very few times , but that 's still high school , that would be really what 's going to do .
i thank you for your attention .
beautiful good evening .
i 'll two two things with things .
when you 're just the first part of the war , you 're going to take a little bit more . ''
there 's another second one , a second .
so let 's start with a moral thing .
this is really , not just , can be a way to do it .
what do you do ?
are there so different types of unendlichkeiten ?
or is n't even enough enough ? enough !
yeah .
this is not well when this is one of what 's going on .
so , in fact , but i 'm going to make it , for the case that you know .
we do n't do that .
we 're just talking with a single one .
and i 'm going to like to take a little bit to a little bit to the endlichen to the endlichen .
ne , we know , we 're seeing , we 're going to know , we 're going to know that we 're going to see ourselves to see ourselves , we 're going to know us to know .
and it 's going to be a mathefreaks for td of a long time , so many of the amount of dollars .
if we 're in the endlichen , endlichen and two propel , in the one , for example , a declan , in the other people in the same people .
we know , now , we 've been looking at the time , the number is small , they 're three , and are three people , and there 's three people .
so we can be thinking , if any of all , is in any of the amount of all the same amount of elements there ?
so , incentives , how would we do it ?
that means we 're going to do the durchzählen , one , two , three , we 're going to get the three , we see the eggs , the world 's three , one , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , three , and
i mean , you know what you 're thinking , yes ?
very beautiful .
it works in the endlichen , which works too much at large numbers , although it 's mid-'80s it .
but it turns out .
how can you make it more ?
how can you talk about that so many people like clocked , right ?
i 've been aware of the music and people and people did n't , and what 's others else .
daraufsitzen eagerly !
it 's called the clothing ! it 's called your friends .
you do that , that 's clear , not , now we 're going to go back in the time , and we 've all know that all the same !
not , that 's very beautiful .
so , she 's called a inwards , and it works . right ?
you take a little bit , you put it back to a chair , from the mouse , '' the plus-one ,
the next pärchen , the next piece of pärchen , everything is that , different people are different to the same thing , no fathom is not a fire , and then a long time , the wouldn’t are big , right ?
now we 're going to move on the horizon .
how can we reconnect two powerful trials together ?
we would say that one is a huge or more powerful or bigger than the other thing .
so , how could we could do it ?
we 'd start again , we would start again .
right . this is wrong , because the point is that if you 're working on a treadmill long , you know , you know , yes , i would probably say , you 're not going to do for the other thing .
ne , chickens , gloomy is , 16,000 , is it 's won’t ?
so , how about it ?
madame ?
no , brain-to-brain !
she was just so easy to it !
they 're clapping for them to them .
so , here we can now look at this .
remember , the surprise is always bad , yes , yes ?
you do n't look at the end , you know , you 're not the end , yeah ?
the point is that you can do it is simple , it 's easy to do it .
if i take the example of the zahlenstrahl , natural , phd , we spend the zero , we 're doing a zero at the beginning , zero , one , two , three , four , five , five , five , five , five , five , five .
and we would say , `` let 's take a copy of this bandes and take this little bit of these personality bleach , and then many numbers are working in the mtts numbers .
left are just going to be the numbers numbers , ok , zero , two , four , four , eight , eight ne ?
okay ?
all the numbers are aufm on the reshaped long , but in a very simple theory of the most brutus , on the other people are the light and the ungeraden , and the ungeraden , right ?
now , let 's call a number of mutates of the result , we call the other number of raced of the natural numbers , and we have a lot of numbers numbers .
what do you think ?
is a lot more powerful , is more powerful than the apologizing or smaller ?
and then , the same big ?
but that 's very low , yes , a little bit of the leone -- the ungeraden , the tacks .
who has another conceivable ?
little bit smaller ?
who is bigger ?
ah , that did n't really have a plan , yes ?
it may not be , yes , yes ?
you ca n't know where things are more powerful , that 's not , leone , ne ?
okay , they say small little bit ?
would you think of it , right ?
that 's the assumption you know , what you 're wrong , is , of course , of course , in fact , wrong , of course .
and now now i 'm sure why i think about the protocells , right now .
how does it work ?
right .
yes , we 're going to be a little bit of people .
that 's the point .
we 're going to kill them . we 're going to give them more .
we take the zero from the atmosphere , we take the zero from the natural amount of natural , tyrannosaurus , are mallard .
the next one , after two , two will two two , is that a zero comes from the one , and i 'll get a time to a haldane , and i 'm going to get a pärchen .
the four , the two , the six , the two , the eight , the four , yes ?
you can also do it , then , where 's going to be able to be fateful , which is , hectares , ne ?
and it 's clear , through the paarungsbildung , we use it that i 'm going to do it in the colliding charted , so it 's a amidst rhythmischen .
and here , there 's one thing , there 's only the light bulb , and the ensuring is , very easy , yes ?
we 're bloop the natural on the atmosphere , hex , the ungeraden , and the cuz is still alone .
and this is just a tweaking that 's not surprising .
so if you 're going to explain some of what 's what we learned from today , sitcom , yes , what am i 've finally been able to have ?
a powerful amount of an example has a realization that are not in the endlichen , and this is the ultimate , the lack of dark , is a charakteristikum , a real conception of which is exactly the big deal of big .
you do n't use it in the endlichen , if you call three three two people , it 's only one thing and there was three .
yes , so we 've done something wrong .
is n't any eingeschlafen ?
okay .
then we 're going to make a second part of the moment , probability .
the males , the probability of the probability of human life .
what 's got here with a ted conference .
and this is a story experiment , i 'm talking about a third , and i think it makes it to someone who has been done , right ?
so , we call the doors to a , a tossing , c , c .
i 've heard behind it , i hope you 've heard about it . you 've heard about it .
and you 're going to be right now .
where , you know , i 've dreamt something , `` a restoring , b , c ?
guess here , our non-stop , here .
they 're sitting on c , she 's sulfide .
who has another person 's worth of us ?
a lot ?
who has another idea ?
sorry , ne , b has been himalayas , not , never seen , probably the immorality of the tweaking , ne , ne ?
so right . it 's right .
it 's really completely bad , so you do n't have to do my three 1940 , and i 'm looking for me .
it 's really bad , yes ? yes ?
it 's because sure that the opportunity you 've been working at random , is actually just a sevitha , a only one , right , in just a third .
ne , there are three things . it 's really , yes ?
now i do i do , i 'm just going to do a little bit of a second .
well , i know what that 's where it 's gone .
wehe , that 's somebody else , decreases , ne .
so i do n't know where it 's the thing , and the albuquerque and the sound and how it is , you know , it 's called million-person , it 's a little bit more in a second round of a second .
so i 'm now going to actually now take the data i can actually start now open now now to do now now .
so it 's so we 're going to go to a second sample .
now , suppose , i am preparing to get this to the hectares , ne ?
so , now i 've got to show a door , which is not what it does n't say , and they do n't have told you .
because if you 're looking at , and i say , and i know , it 's not a b , right ?
then , there would n't have no second round of a second .
i say i 'm insides , standstill , the mouse , a little bit , but it 's been a little bit more glamorous .
but i have to think that 's this spielregel , to go into the second show .
so i 'm just a celsius , which is not just about , but what you did n't have said , `` well , what you do n't have .
now , the question is , and this is the kind of a human being , where the period here is , under the area that it 's open , and it 's not in this , you 've got your right , you have now your last chance to
you 're going to use on a game , then i do a irene , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
i do n't know what you want to do .
or they say , `` i do n't listen to bill . ''
now , the progressively is that they 've been more likely to make more , if you 've been more likely to make more , if you 've done more ?
puh , very beautiful , is that i 'm , i know , it 's domains .
or , god is that god has been open , i always wanted to go to a little , that 's it .
or you would say , `` well , we 've got outpouring , we 've got , ne , we 're only about two companies , it 's no way , to be able to do , or not just keep
what do you do ?
it 's not no .
fifty-fifty .
why is n't it ? why is n't it ?
very beautiful .
why is it why is it fifty-fifty ?
yeah , exactly right , that 's wrong , that 's wrong .
that 's almost almost when we had it einstudiert yesterday , ne , ne ?
but so they are , ne , are new new fun , fun .
so , you 're really aware of this , it 's very simple , yes , yes .
so all of the things i do n't know , i do n't know , six , and i do n't eat sechzig years ago , can i do n't i go out of the same time , instead of myself , ne ?
so , it 's actually nephites everyone in the same time .
behind this door , it 's a thee , a dissecting .
and it 's still just to a third of a dog behind a door , right ?
you can know what you want , you have , you have , you have , you have , you have , with two symbols , they 're going to be gh in your toes .
that means you could n't find on two doors , not , you can do , in order to do , you can get on two dozen , then you are , `` well , it 's a ne , if you put the fish , but that 's all the life
but here we just have a door to see .
so , this is what you 're is , two third is not what you 're doing is what you 're doing , you know , you know , you know , you know ?
so , the two third here , but it can be just behind the door !
behind you , it 's not !
so , what 's more than you 're going to be more ?
it 's a little bit , i 've just laid out !
so what 's more likely to spend more ?
it 's better to go or how much control ?
now it 's simple , yes ? yes , yes ?
yes , of course , of course , of course !
so that was n't enough to be , very hard ne ?
ha ! ha !
what do we see ?
they 've been a little bit more than a little bit more than you 're doing .
why ?
it 's very , the second is not a hundred percent of the right , the difference between the real and the miley of practice and practice .
i hope it was for everybody else , '' with this .
thank you very much .
mr. reichert , she 's going to be thames by the people’s singularly , who 's just heard of bad food and bad food and mid-'80s people and the people who wrote the macmaster , the listener is really wrong ,
but i 'm going to say my best that will be all of it all over time , this little bit of the work , right ?
i 'm going to come from demeter demeter , and i was 12 to the most part of the co-founding , right ?
so , that 's been working on , all right .
yeah , yeah .
thank you very much for you very much today .
i grew up to ep again .
and i do n't know whether or no , not , before , did n't know about it before i ask you to be able to go to ted ted at the center of the center and talk about a particular subject .
i was dataset to me rausgesucht : the theme of trust .
sure , obviously , no , is not a bad and i 'm going to call me the wife 's mutate reichert , who said , maybe power or a better time , but i would have more likely to eat .
but i 'm going to have been building with this very part of the way .
so today , i 'd like to go back to the embodying , but it would be much more modernize , but i have to leave tomorrow , because i 'm in three weeks to the embodying , contemporaries , to mid-'80s , and these are fünfhundertvierzig miles --
i 'm not going to go back to the morning , my own embodies , not to sulfide the training of the teachers .
so the blind thing , you want to do , rennradfahren , tomorrow , in the abendtal , i 'm called the `` you 're all welcome to you all of you .
i 've got to say , `` well , i 'm going to say sprech to heut about the subject to the subject .
and i started to go , as well , with the theme of urvertrauen ,
no good , the beautiful , little abgedroschene , blind , near-death faith , outbreaks paleoanthropology midtown top-10 , amplification transferring , mosses transferring , acorn .
i was told me to talk about it , when i was a embodies , how can i am at the best i know where do i do i do to be able to do i do i do herkomm ?
so i 'm going to come up with six hours , six weeks , a few parents , and in my parents , the trickier on the black world , there is no transfixed , apfelsaft and apfelsaft -- and what makes you jersey from
trust , for the course , of course , in fact , not , but not to me , say , `` apfelsaft and beer and beer .
why am i tell the story where i was going to be ?
for me , one of the very stories that i really did right to the country , and there was a two days , with the great brother , with the british brother , the sehend of the
and with the second brother , which is the best person who i like .
it means that it looks like and just lower , dark , which is how i can also see where the hawn window in the room , whether it 's light or it 's light or , and it 's light .
what 's very important today to be the stromrechnung .
the way , or we can see the only way we can see if we 're something about us is that , to be , is something that we can see .
'n 'n , but i 'm going to be coming from , i ca n't use , is a es'n osmium oder'n oder'n .
the first of the old men , infrequently .
it always starts to celsius through this moment .
and what i 've been doing is really , to me is , of course , the fact , how do you think about how do you do , and you just have this great trust , the urvertrauen that we all need , is something that is something more in'ne , so i 'm going to be a little bit of
and that was also , for my parents , as her as many of you , my brother and my friends knew me .
we were so the first thing that we 've been relatively recently in their lives .
and then they had to do it with the situation , what you had to do is doing , what is doing ,
and , now , i think it 's a little bit of my mind that my parents , not been the day , and we 're going to go to the hand , or to say , `` it 's ne , you 're going to get you back , and then you feel standstill where you 're
a would have been the strange thing : we were home for the lapse so much .
and b vista our dreams of us to try to go back , where our world is a brother 's escher .
so , in the house with the street alone , the treppen , motto and runterzurennen , it also even be dead .
there 's the blind blind , i was sending me with the spielzeugtraktor brothers , frill transferring contemplate unter'n in expectancies , hepburn , too .
the narbe of the narbe , i 've been looking for today today .
so with this large example , these are fantastic songs , they 're not just good for their own , but the appachan of the schönheitsfehler .
and our brothers and my brothers and i was looking at the originated , but i really look at the top , which was really all over the tweaking , which is a embodying , who was all about the organically , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example ,
and that 's what we 've been talking about the assigning brothers with three years , and then we wanted to say -- of michael , and i 'm going to do it , and i 'm going to do it .
and then , starting to start with a.d , how many little kids , o'neill with the tractors is foreseeable alles'n .
so the way that the kiddies can do this .
but we 've been working with stützrädern , and without the other hand .
and then the big question : how does square-foot , how did you go ?
and how you want to trust this , the deposition of the parents , that children are going to come back from the kitchen and bacchanal and other things that we do n't care about that we 're not going to be located where we do n't have a apologizing where we
and our solution was that we have a lions of our parents , where it 's the risikostellen , where where it 's a featuring , where there are some money stuff , you 're not
and we had to do that in the world , which is that the one of the end of us , but the other hand also does n't hear the same time .
and you can do n't think of all over time , because otherwise , it 's going to be so here you 're not going to have any more of them .
but heut .
and you can try and just durch'n durch'n with the ear to make , and you 're going to find that , because people are also people like all of them -- they 're going to hear a resistance .
so the fact that the silenced that you 're going to hear about is now standstill , euros , because the content is because the power is just going to be different from the same way .
and this is for me , i think , in fact , the trust , is also the way , it 's been in the movement , always really important .
but auch'ne work to work and the security : i was able to help me to help e.u. the help of my piece of time .
and i 'm not saying to make a lot of people with a lot of things , and sure , without a lot of calories without having a few other or other people , of course , of course , there was already .
what i do n't have to do n't have a lot of things that i 'm very bedaure to do , from one of our most powerful , of our lieblingssportarten , as children ,
so , from the confessed in the flop building , it was a wellness , where we 've seen from the top .
i 've got here to this guy : the elites also is also through a stückweit diversity of a stückweit diversity .
and i mean , i 'm very much because i 've been able to have a lot of words , and i think about the coachingausbildung with the science side , and i 'm never talking about , which is never a
i never had told that it would also be even much as much as well as well as well as well as well .
but also , also , to do n't have to do that , of course , there 's no longer , because of all the way that you can actually have done so dismal in terms of expertise .
privacy is in our understanding of our strength of the allerwichtigste to know where to myself , where am i 'm doing now , what did i have to provide risks , where can i really do my ronald really made a lot of carroça ?
and our brother just looked at his own , and i always gl on the streets to the house , and i 'm talking about the house .
so , we said , okay , we 're looking at a osmakac here .
you can put somewhere from the window to dreamer window from the example of the example , for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , to be a he’s , for example ,
and the drifting went down , lawless , and i 've probably had to have been so'n to so'n her little girl , ne ne , i do n't know .
but last time , who are going to look at the bottom ?
so i do n't .
and i think about the way , we are the generation of young young people here , not yet .
and so i 've been thinking about it , and i 'm always going to do , but i 'm hoping it 's too much more .
and then the story was that we would come back to three of the three aufm fathom , and the friend of storyline with bandstand traktor and yet did n't know what he was doing to say .
because trust is , of course , when we 're going to think of the other question as if you 're going to ask if others are thickness .
so the guy would say , `` god '' tell you , help , help , the risk of large , that one of the three-fifths , and i did n't know about the runtergeflogen , curaçao , -gesprungen , -gekullert --
but yet , never happened .
he was always e.u. , he was able to be able to be strongest , or unto vorausgeschickt , which made us to talk about us .
and that 's what i was doing is that i was really great to me that we had these tools , but we had this opportunities .
but sure , no , it 's no debating , no , to try to make it more e.u. .
for me , the different sportarten , which was always been in my life , always , all right , interesting interesting , yes .
and yet , they were all of these gov because i could see , where i did , i know , what i can call my own thing , and maybe , like my hometown .
so , with no ner good werferin , i could never have never been able to do .
and i did n't had to oberkörpermuskulatur the oberkörpermuskulatur of it .
and i 'm going to say goodbye to today , because today i 'm not in banning today .
i 'm going to go out to the same way to make up in blood , and it 's about in the context of the world .
now , not at five times as a lot of times like the moment .
and in strömendem , but -- even more than being the same time .
but i also have been doing this for me to be the best in my strength that i could have different kinds of sportarten , so i 'm trying to help live sportarten .
for the first time , for example , when first first time , they 're judo .
and that was a good thing , because of the inwards who had us in the judoverein , we said , `` well , we 've been iss my children , and tribunal the babies die of us
in fact , it 's good , because you 're going to show you a little bit more novelist on the ground .
and then you look at what the other thing is doing something like this .
and there was always my great trust , and though , when i 'm going to be the hoo long time , it 's difficult to get it because it can be the idea of what i can do , which i do n't mean .
so , it 's just one way : and that 's what i call is doing that in my laptop ,
the other hand h takes a foot in the leiste , and i can leave you to see myself the experimentally , and then it 's the back , and the competition is , because the fact that the semiconductors suggests that
i 'm not going to do this here .
i had been interested in my ne , so i was doing it .
i 'm called the answer , i 'm also a little bit of sense of laughter , so it 's a little bit more .
and so i should n't have any of a metaphor for this , right ?
ne .
honey , i 've got dacht . ''
okay .
the next thing to me is a really interesting school in the school , the sportskilanglauf of the panicked and just rielly , right ?
my parents were home , or with me are bullseye , and that , they have been doing something like children , and children , who are more than children .
but for me , i 've been able to feel like this : what can i do myself with a lot of the school , to become my school to go my best energy ?
and there it was , when i had a way to make a way to do in school school .
and even though i was always thought , this is all of the bissl bissl , because langlauf langlauf is a little bit more retrain , 15th , `` i 'm going to do .
i found out of all -- i 'm not find , because i 'm not going to do today today .
i 've told you all : i 'm going to say , well , i 'm going to go with boca , you know , in the same time , right ?
and i said , `` first , the person , again , this is the great diversity here in the audience because you have to make sense , you need power , you know , good news and 1st is'n teamsport .
klingeling : do n't have a lot of things in their work ?
that 's exactly what it 's also in the langlaufen , it 's also in the langlaufen .
you can just get quickly , if you just have the full effects of the whole thing in the own technology .
if you have the trust that in your own power -- the power , you will also have the same thing , in the same way , the bad weather , the lapse , the vereisten , hoax vereisten , to the back of the atom .
and if you have in my case , my case , i think , has been told that trust in the team , '' in the team ,
because as a sportlerin , who did n't look , i 've been commissioned to auf'n auf'n .
and i never know , i was n't like krasses krasses today -- i have to use the word -- my vorrednerin -- there was just one -- i 've been doing for me , even though my own story is still my own life .
but it 's nothing wrong , we do n't make it again again again .
i 'll be able to leave me to just a moment i can just get even now .
go with one , one of you , one of you spend a little bit more likely to get a little bit more .
what i 'm always doing is doing is doing is doing something that is what makes the responsibility to trust , which is the end of the matrix , as it 's the way that if you do n't see it just a little bit more and make revive langlauf , and you 're going to debates down stundenkilometer'n .
so in the most isses isses , so you 're two deflect in the hand .
so , from that , i 'm not going to go out of the patient , because i could call my favorite blindenstock , and i can quotations the lorbeere lorbeere ,
ca n't .
so i have to help me help .
i then put my begleitläufer , which was the way i could be fascinated with me , was the 71 of time .
and the explains the voice voice polycentric the time .
so , the need is to do just get to be doorstep , so it 's always going to do ansagen .
and also , that 's important for trust .
the happy in the communication system , so in the ansagen , so in the ansagen .
and the begleitläufer says i 'm going to be hopp , when the inwards says to me and rechtskurven , who says , `` i 'm going to go to the end of music , then i 'm going to just look at the left , and so that it 's going to
when he says , the left , on a little bit more characterizes , left , on the left , and when he says , `` right , right on the right , right on the bottom .
okay , all right ? all right ?
then , isses isses problem , because then i 'm going to be able to be nachfragen or not to be able to stop myself , then i know , anything i 'm not alive . right ?
and for me , i think it 's a big , brain-to-brain , when the begleitläufer of me , i 'm going to do that , i have to really really hectares the really ausliefern to go to the music to make it down to the
to say , `` well , i think that for me , '' for me , i think that i 'm going to do it for me to get it to be , and then it 's also going to be easy to the body , and it 's also more than a more effective than others , and so that they 're going to start to macmaster the
and that 's what i can do , if i 'm able to do is with a poor , with two families to me , i 'm going to do in a leg , and i really have to do the eyes , and you can have to get rid of them -- or ha ha , or no one
and then , it 's got to fahrn and then , in the other leg and all over and see here , and you can take a little bit more , and then you have a little bit , but it 's got to make you happy to
also too high , strudwick high school , also too much more effective .
yes , and this is a really exciting thing , when i 'm going to be taj , like i 'm saying , i say to say , `` i just told you guys like i 'm doing this , you know , i want to say the right thing , because the
so that does n't know what he must tell me to do .
so i 'm one that the only thing that he 's going to have been building the way of communication is , to do it .
and that 's how every arbeitsprozess .
if anyone do n't know , i could n't help people , but i 'm going to be asked , and i 'm going to say , `` i do n't need to come up with you , you know , you 're going to have to get rid of you , you can actually get rid of you , you can actually yorkers the
or i have to tell you about now as you 're wondering , you 're also told me how much of the mountain is because , when you 're going to be the nt pfänder , but you 're going to get , but you 're going to think , but it 's going to be there .
and just in a way , just like salient , and that 's the thing , it does n't really feel like it .
and so i 've also told the pilot , like the orally , where the discourage , then i told you about only 30 minutes behind us , so we 're going to be iss in the last few minutes ,
so i think that 's really interested in the very good , because also , the silenced that you can see , interpol ansagen , you know , have been e.u. .
i 'm saying reassemble . here are another person who can get lhc auf'n ?
who are more than any of the more ?
so my best time was , even though , but it was a tweaking , and now , in fact , in the age , i was actually known to me , i never had ever been able to do it as well as well as sandbox as well .
and at the panicked in the teased , right now , right , right , right , right , right , right , right , right , right , right ?
and for me , i said that , i think that these are just ansagen will be even if i 've got my own content , '' and i 'm just going to open my ears , ''
the other thing that i was told about what he looks about to see and i was so much more and clearer the opportunity to my own perfect copulate .
and that 's one of the very important things that i say , trust is more fear and not that capita sprichwörtliche , not that blindenvertrauen sprichwörtliche .
so , of course , words , `` not , not as much as well , '' really said , `` simultaneous '' -- from the blindenvertrauen , '' and the wield of the tacks .
because i 've been working on the very first time that i had a begleitläufer on the right and the right wrong or left behind the left left , right ?
and then that was the cuz in the sun , but it 's like a thyself from the 1970s , three times runterging .
and i 'm going to get three insula per second .
so , from that , like , that was that -- there was lapse -- klar'n klar'n , which is , like it .
and i know that , because the begleitläufer of maltese , you 've got to go on , so you have to spiegelverkehrt spiegelverkehrt ansagen , so you can do spiegelverkehrt ansagen .
and i 'm now today , there are the people i say people : the left left and say , `` ne , the other left , the next left .
so then , the right , unfortunately , unfortunately , unfortunately , unfortunately .
power does n't do much more comfortable on this , not so much .
but sure , in a situation that 's so'ner in trusts , that you probably probably all have been from the work or the university as it was always as if you have to work again , and then you have to go to work .
then , of course , my belief is often so'n so'n of hard challenge .
but for me , as i said , `` blindes blindes is that i have to know the risks to do .
and i 'm going to say , i 'm as someone as someone who are n't really large , in a way , because i 'm going to have my own mutates , in my own interest in many ways .
so in the langlaufen , i 've been so much for me , i 've just so much so that i 'm doing this .
from the tweaking tree , from the informing , tiefschnee , and i know , `` i said , '' and -- that 's the important thing -- i 'm sure the `` heart '' is not the good pages .
and then it 's going to be done when the trust is that there is there .
and if you 've ever seen someone who actually actually have a hundred percent of how much as i 'm doing is that i 'm doing .
and i had also had the same goals to do the same goals .
because this is because i think , for me , i think , in the theme of trust , the next , very important thing .
you need to make the same goal , and i really have to actually understand what 's true , really , what is this really , to say to trust , trust , to do trust ?
because the theory is often himalayas so'n , which you have been used to do .
i was interested in the person or whether or myself , i remember myself .
but the most important thing is n't that there 's a lot of view , so far on it , so many of it .
you can take you to trust a lot of trust , much of us .
and that 's what we do is -- because people are going to be connected to irgend'nem irgend'nem irgend'nem : we want to see it makes sense of sense , so you want to make sense to see it .
and the sense of this , the fact is , we 're often often that we also also have to have to make a hoo to 'n through the world .
that we have it -- in my case , for example , from many , my friends , i was going to go on the klimandscharo , i went to the klimandscharo .
and there 's the same thing i 'm going to say , i 'm going to be somebody who 's going to be happy , who or i can say that in the case that i can actually do this , i 'm going to have this whole line of the top of the top .
and how do you do that you can also come to the top of the back back at the top ?
well , i 've heard the evidence that i 've had done some of the things i 've been not going to be so if you 're going to be a day when i 'm going to go to me , i 'm talking about me a thousand meters of runterging .
then i was really fortunate to me , and i was really excited about it .
can be a druchaus'n advantage , then the reason is not the problem of not a problem .
and i 've been working on the most mutates , but why it 's based on the klimandscharo , i 'm going to go to and i 've got a swings , or i was in lapse baseflying , you 're bandstand with so'nem stahlseil abgelassen ,
this is a little bit more deflect , when you get it down the car , and you ca n't see a lot to see a lot to know , right now , you know , now , when i 'm going to be able to do ,
and these things are for me to me , i 've been working for me .
and to understand the adrenalinkick , but to say , `` i 'm war , '' i 'm going to do , '' and i can just do it , and can just get a new new experience .
and just the isses auch'n auch'n , because of the euthanasia fathom , so you 're going to go every day , and there 's a few days , and it 's just been just going to be a little bit more
you go and goes and has even been able to get rid of food around , you can still have less plants , and it 's less plants .
you take a anfang'n ranger , mid-east paleoanthropology from the world war in the first world war ii .
so , if you look at mal'n transfixed , then the ranger is about about the last one that the hawn of the erlegt , which is the erlegt .
it 's the only thing that the only exciting thing to do is that right now .
we 've seen the inwards only from the distance , or the other thing .
so , from banning , i have a lot of meditated trust in the ranger , despite his career , who had him been able to get it up .
because i thought , well , so , like i said , `` i do n't know how i 'm going to be faster faster than how the mustafa has been shown in .
but as it said it 's pretty much eintönig , because you 're going to be sich'rum , you know , not so much , really , really , you know , so much , it 's not so much to change a lot of change .
and really , really , what 's going to be surprised when it 's something that is difficult to be a little bit more .
so , when you go to the bottom line and then the air is rendered boca .
or if it comes to a runtergeht , if you have so'n so'n , where the left is right , right right right right right right right : right ?
then it 's particularly beautiful , and if it 's home , and all of stirnlampe , it has to kilograms the teased , and then we would ask me to be able to take me back to the zedong , so he would actually feel the
because as it was as a only without fractures without dreamer , and it was , sometimes it was sometimes sometimes , sometimes , sometimes sometimes , sometimes sometimes , sometimes sometimes , sometimes , sometimes it 's too much more .
trust , we 've been done that i said , `` now , i 've got to have a swings , my friend who was about , five years , i call them , '' and we 've done that , and we 've done it before .
but i also need to have a ne shape , i 'm not going to have to shave , because you can see if you 're going to go on the mountain , the fashions 's links'n , right next to the right , on the right , at the left ,
you will get some time you 're going to end up , and everyone 's all about that , right now ?
so for us for us , we 've been looking at the point , we 're uns'ne uns'ne , so we 're going to put a ball on their lap , which i was going to be in the hand , and i went from the three-fifths baumelnden on the
in his other hand'n , i 've been doing this little bit more so'n , the guessed of the ball , which i would have seen the teased , the der ever made .
and she 's just a little bit of 'cause , or she had a embodying gegen'n solidify , which i knew was what was going to be able to do what i was doing , and i did n't have to focus on the tacks .
and what i 've been doing is that was what 's the way it 's been , if you did , then , again , it 's happening , because of course , it 's a little bit of the same thing you really have this point of it in a little bit of the time -- you see how it 's like mockup , and you can have
but the other thing is that i realized that the fact that i was in obscura , i 'm saying , `` i 'm now domains if i 'm really so'n so'n , like the top thing you see .
but the trust is also , in fact , there is something like the other , the mitkriegen of how things are working .
when we just looked at the mountain in the mountain , we were in the group of the moment , and we were sitting on the other people who were all over the world , and it was always a little bit behind us and why , always i tell you that
and at the night , you ca n't also see by the girls who are at the back of the time .
that 's actually not true reason anything about it .
and then i came to me , i 'm going to say , ah , their intuition is to trust their own ability to be a little bit more convenient times before .
you 're going to go to the embodying of the dark , you 're 12 12 years , it 's not just light light , you know , not the light bulb .
this is totally aphorisms , when you 're übermüdet , the air is going to be a thyself , so you only are now not eameses , and now not even more vergügenssteuerpflichtig , but now it 's not more vergügenssteuerpflichtig , but now it 's not more vergügenssteuerpflichtig .
and then , the moment of the moment where the guy said , `` man , that was really easy to go behind , because the friend of me , i realized that , i just told me all the time , i just got all the time
all of the whole night , we talked about , and the other people in the group had been able to know , hectares , bestärkung , well , it 's been noch'ne at a minute , which is what she told me
or i 've got to do you with a lot of things at all of the mountain .
and so , in fact , that 's a reason why , somebody else , maybe it may be good bad , we might have been eu before , there 's only more hours a year before , the sun will go on the sun ,
and so these things that are missing from the information , and it can be bullseye , and it can be able to make sure that the more copulate contemplate , it 's also the personal plotting .
and for me , i think , is that , in fact , trust and is actually , when it 's the perfect thing that if you were so much more and the thing that you really want to do , actually , the way is to be the idea of the things that there is .
that 's why , in the pitching , where you do n't know how bad i do n't do that , you know , maybe i do n't know , to know , to know , to me to get the value or you know , even if it 's only more likely to be , but , is it just
so i think it 's a little bit more , at the yes/no , which is that a little bit less nervously , so many deteriorate , so many transfixed .
if that all the real market is , i 'm not going to be here , then i would be on the bahamas , i am , i think i 'm going to do , i think i 'm going to show me the street , i think .
or at least in informing , irgendso'n censor irgendso'n .
but as i said , `` well , what you 're doing is that it 's more to you , what i 've been told , `` what i 've been doing , and how i 've got my skills and create power on a point .
and i 've been in my own , but of course , in a team that we all need , whether or in the school , in the school , in the job in the time , it 's always done .
anyway , when old man or young woman , we need people , we can trust the way that we can trust .
and if we have this goal in the head , and we have to have changed it , the truth that we could have to be at least in a project in a project in our lifetime .
and if you can see it , you can also be able to be able to be able to be in other different ways .
thank you very much indeed .
a science for me , this is the title of my talk , who has been bullseye to drucklegung drucklegung of their beautiful maps of the beautiful maps .
what 's reminded me to be the tiefsitzende tiefsitzende that the science of a bit more than a little bit more than samaritan in the moral population , to be million-person .
i think there 's a way i could be grateful .
when i 'm in a buchhandlung , there 's only part of the regalmeter , particularly ark with the most leone to science , the chiat populärwissenschaftlich .
even every zeitschriftenkiosk , a range of populärwissenschaftlich populärwissenschaftlich transferring , engineers , magazinen , where our creative ideas , hochkomplexe things , pogue changes , in the way , it 's going to be able to be able to get .
every single person has gone at least a embodying , where we 're going to be able to do , as important of our imagination , in order to do something that we 're doing .
even , that 's totally abstrus , if you look what it looks at photographs and magazinen for children 's scientific science , science , the scientific ideas .
every single one of a sudden , a whole ensuring in a kioskregal , but yet it 's a very konsumierende story .
science is one thing that i like to look at the same thing i can read like , but that does n't even have myself to myself .
cool , cool is science in nephites , with breaking , humankind , somewhere , the apologizing , cool , ne ?
now , in a little five minutes , five minutes , has never been doing with the reality , but that 's cool , ne , ne , ne ?
there i can do , because i can see myself .
big bang , i can do this stuff , i do n't think about it , i do n't understand the mutates , but it 's great stuff , so it 's great .
it 's extremely bad .
because , this is kind of a little bit of the sense that the future will be able to solve with these technologies and ideas .
but at the same time , this is no one for the same thing for her self , to itself .
i got a few little examples of how things or is not only or not just been so far away from us so that we 've been doing this .
a very example , for a very exciting example : in london , in a half , built a great humanly , supertoll , the architect , not only so we just build this way that we kind of leone it as a way that works like this .
what happens is that the oil comes out of the eagerly , so i 've been able to do that , the mcclure , and then it has over a thyself , in the other hand at a point of zusammenkommt .
this was big through the press , because there 's a moment that we 're probably going to be a u.n. 's cross-train .
so , the real thing , the urged has been kanalisiert so that this poor jaguarbesitzer , which is really long , long , long , there are the außenspiegel außenspiegel außenspiegel .
so , you know , a chemist , this has not really kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of kind of a little bit of physics in the world , because i mean , it 's been a new thing that it was very much better
so what i found was , new york is archimedes , sort of zweihundert before , where he had to have a whoever with a branch of they’ll .
i mean , i think i really know what 's more important or tilt , where or did it ?
now this is a very important example of a very exciting example .
a friend who made this very different about things , is also the gentechnik gentechnik .
gentechnik , now , a few years ago when it was so much to the same thing in the media , and i said , in the media ,
there was the train shredded , because of course , the unexpected nature plants , which was a risk of itself , which is a risk .
genes was a cuz , moma abandoning , a second life .
genes are kind of what makes a good thing to do .
ne , oh , there are genes , there are genes , there are wouldn’t genes .
there were interested in where the market farmers had been really farmers , `` hey , i 've got genfreies vegetables .
no idea what 's going to be , yes .
so , yeah , okay , so , gt , wyly consultants , we can take it to be so that we 're doing it .
but the time i was still in the lab , i was a little bit of music because i 've been trying to do these internist genes in my bacteria , these verfluchten mistdinger , these verfluchten mistdinger .
and , quite ironic , was home , and i mean , my father , och och , you do n't look at something , what is it going to go ?
i 'm like , yeah , i 'm trying to take a very long three years in my bacteria , and it does n't work .
so that 's what i tried to explain , i think , a sort of obeys , education , i thought , `` the good lady , when i talk about genes , you know what you 're saying .
that was what i actually did , i think , a certain sequence that i wanted to have to go there to be able to get there to be able to get there to be able to get to noting in the verfluchten kolis .
but that was what the woman was taught ,
this woman has never been the hand me behind me , please , please stop it .
who knows what i mean to mediterranean them ? ne ?
genes is what makes a magic model .
now this is now a very much 10 years , and yet it has a sense in the sense , the possibility of consciousness , right ?
genes that 's true what makes it been good .
i was really not happy to be very long long before it .
it 's still built by using technology , and it has actually been able to have a cuz in our language , which is what we 've done .
super-genmais super-genmais itself , was a virus , a plotting .
genmais is also a lot of other sorts of other people who are at all the fact that no longer the genes , and yet genes , right ?
another colleague , genmais genmais patriarch would die to be midst .
yes , that was also a beautiful doctor .
now , these are n't so old , and it 's also not possible that i 'm going to get more to think of the way to me , i 'm going to get me to feel more .
whether it 's the time or the time or the image , all of the declan , genmais of genmais , right ?
so , luckily , it 's not inner in the duden , but i 'm sure that i do n't really have any more long , so i do n't have more long .
but that 's just a really counterintuitive , which is in the population , because it 's just not going to do with the ideas for the ideas .
ironically , we need to be in our future with these technologies , of course , in our technologies .
now , i was just bundestagswahl , nobody had the big deal of the topic , but it will be about things about things like the reintroduce and eighty , of course , what most of the most of the things that most of the action of the things .
and that 's pretty sad .
how does this point out of this information from the lab ?
if we think of this , a little boy , young , young scientists , in the lab , a experiment , forscht , beautiful and beautiful , and he 's light , you 're thinking , which is , that 's what 's actually going to do ,
then , this is all that at the church that you have to go to the professor .
the war , who decides the mermaid , okay , a story , a dog is erstautor , as it 's always important in science , erstautor , erstautor .
good idea , i still do n't still have in the public , it 's a thyself , but it 's a pressesprecher .
yes , the pressesprecher , think , oh , oh , great idea , wonderful , we 're going to make a pressemitteilung draus .
in a way , here we have a pressemitteilung with a project , a beautiful idea , and this is where it comes to good-news out of the elfenbeinturm , and it 's a little bit .
so that 's going to be ausgespuckt , yes , but what do you do ?
now , the company is rarely been growing up to grow , despite the whole lot of forschungsinstitute , so many of these teased , so they have a lot of work , a common forschungsgemeinschaft , a common forschungsgemeinschaft .
and from all of this , the georg , the very important projects , the exquisitely , the emeka on the history , the plus-one , whether it does n't use it , fraunhofer , helmholtz , helmholtz , helmholtz , helmholtz , helmholtz , helmholtz , helmholtz , helmholtz , max-planck-gesellschaft , max-planck-gesellschaft ,
that 's the way .
from the bottom , it 's always going to move on the informing , in the elfenbeinturm , the very , very cool , the very detects , then really internist nennenswerten projects , in the magazinen , there are in this magazinen ,
these are very striking choirs , which are really good , there are all of the things you 're on , but who are i going to get the money ?
basically , just the fact that it 's important to use this thing .
in the wissenschaftskommunikation , we call it the deposition of the katholiken of the katholiken .
so , the way , the point is going to be interested in , the abonnieren , then the abonnieren , yes , beautiful and good .
beautiful magazine , the 39 who are doing this , and they may have about one idea , where wodrüber are boca in this job .
but who are the erreich of the `` do i really do it ? ''
the katholiken that would be really interested in it .
the taser , so , in the orally , i call it fringes , müller-schulze transferring , who was mallard by a lot of other teased , i tried to stop it , i do n't really do that , i do n't really do that ,
but yet , again , our future , we will only get to pogue in a baron , if we 're going to do with these zukunftstechnologien properties .
communicated , gentechnologie , aka energy , stammzellenforschung , these are all these things that are hochkomplex , who are n't hochkomplex , who 's not really wrong , but not really understand and understand that he 's going to be able to do .
so my project , my idea is so much more sophisticated , these little , young scientists , trying to take out of the elfenbeinturm , to make sure that by lapse , and he talked to a organically , how we 're
so what happens , what happens to think that a lot of scientists , i have a disseminating , we know , seven years ago , it 's elektro-ingenieur , it 's a ungeschriebene rule , it 's not to go to
as he was able to aufmacht the mouth and he had his little son , he had torre us to us .
ne , these are scientists who tell you a bit like dehydrogenmonoxid , you know .
hu , listen to chemisch , ne , chemisch is almost so much as the same way as genes as genes .
chemisch reassemble , this is kind of , it 's kind of , oh , you do n't know what 's going on .
so , really , the way to do , look at the time , and that 's beautiful , if you 're on a conference and you know , your experimentally , you know , your laparoscopically , you want to tell you about , you can tell you from dehydrogenmonoxid , but they 're going to tell you from dehydrogenmonoxid , but doc ,
where is the problem of it to make it more tolerant and normal ?
so i 'm sorry , this is the idea that many scientists are not so far in the tweaking that are still a little bit of interest , who i 'm concerned , you know , i 'm just like to be a seventy , you can use it in a digesting .
it has to use a product , drittmittelgeber , as investors , the researchers who know what 's happening in the forschungsinstituten , what happens to be in the forschungsinstituten .
eventually , they 're also going to be more likely to be able to be able to be , so that actually have to actually have to detect the steuerzahlern of the steuerzahlern .
but these are the whole thing that is just a story .
i really want to do it , if you really want to take a blank slate , and you want to imagine your team , your project , a project of a spreadsheet , dwarfed , erbarmungslos , erbarmungslos , maccready , worse , worse , it 's not , children .
there 's a quote , i do n't know whether it 's really , about ebay old , if you ca n't really get it , you do n't really understand it .
so , the scientists to take the lab and their project to describe , how can i really afford that help ?
so all of the stories is a lot of stories .
kinderunis are totally modern , is everywhere in every university , but also , i 've actually moved on the back of the katholiken , and i 've actually been the katholiken .
who is the next end of the city to the university , some of this is going to be a symbol of unmenschlichen tageszeiten ?
these are the ones that are going to be really excited about .
and i 've looked at my eye , and i 've been my zeitungsleser .
so , these are the people who are going to be interested in this way that you go down and put it in a few boys here .
this is beautiful , there will be a little bit , you all are n't ready , all right are happy , you go home and that 's it .
so i 'm still looking at a second aspect to say , there 's no longer the internet , of the einmal-vorstellen of the project .
these scientists will even get to see how berserk are actually children ?
because many of the really verlernt have been able to reduce the annually to the murden .
because scientists , like the model , and how children are doing their world , is the same thing .
children work very quickly , very low , very well .
they 're doing something that learning how they go from .
you try and make it , does it work ?
patsch , lights , no way , not so much , but i want to make a few taj , it 's still a new time .
children learn extremely fundamental knowledge of the world .
these are really forschungsprozesse , try and error , which i realized , which i should change is that it works or not ,
that 's normal !
but these are many many verlernt .
and i think that , i think , but it 's just the way that you would take the patenschaft of the panicked , and those scientists , in the living , and the environment , the tacks of the students , and i think , that 's why i think , that scientists actually actually be the same language
and then you might think , maybe that 's my hope , and the kids , the kids , the kids , then i would have to sleep home , and then i 'm afraid of standstill , but then to get some of our personal interest , because the children who have told you
that 's not in the newspaper , which is not somewhere , and his children will tell him something that it worked for a hohlspiegel , a celsius , which is that it 's also pharmacy , and then , then , the citi can
and not just i 'm going to say , `` i 'm afraid of hectare , but also the zeitungsleser zeitungsleser .
that 's my idea , my vision , my vision , my project .
unfortunately , it 's been doing that , the first testkandidaten that i said , `` all , said , `` yes , no , acre , for a scientist , our personal story that is not a theme , which is just the other thing that they 've got
a lot of people have n't communicate as well .
yeah , i think so , ok , then i 'm going to let the next to you , i 'm going to go to the next person .
but who actually works in a program , elektro-ingenieur is a way of the company , as far as it 's , there 's a next night , as you go to the next night .
thank you very much .
i 'm crazy , is the question .
so you can not fly out every day .
the last weeks ago , terrible were terrible .
the weather has been a whole set out of the paper that was made it to the classroom .
seven years , eight years , i was asked to whether i 'm going to do here , i 'm going to go out here .
i was born , trappings 10 years , where the dornier regionalflugzeuge in wouldn’t and münchen in pfaffenhofen , in pfaffenhofen .
we 've been so far up to right there .
they were eu lufthansa , for clients , you know , your enemies .
and for me , it was actually , but , that 's why i 'm liebhaberei .
what is that actually to do ?
luftschiffe , this is really ridiculous , right now .
but i 've learned that , who i learned from this is where i 'm here today , here i am here today .
and i 'm going to do a little bit , but it 's also about it to be true to be true to be true .
it 's beautiful and always , and a big job of fun .
and i 'm just going to go to you in the next siebzehn , still-growing minutes , a little bit of this life from this life of a zeppelingeschäftsführers of a zeppelingeschäftsführers ,
i 'm a humanly in zeppelinluftschiffbau .
the company has been a long years and fünft and fünft years ago .
i 'm a humanly of zeppelinluftschifftechnik .
this company has been in the age of 20 years .
and simultaneous abandoning .
the company has been since since the neunzehn or obeys years ago .
now , the panicked has been shown here in the bodensee , right now .
predicated out of the spectrum .
and so , this is a picture that i want to show you this , that little bit right now , this is actually a red , a rachel , or something , you know , not that case , that 's just a part of this thing .
there 's only been luftschiffe in the world since dreiundzwanzig teased .
and they 're just used to spend 10 to be more than a declan , which is n't there , 100 .
and that 's what you 've done something like this .
there are about 10,000 billion of global warming , so far .
so that 's actually not yet market .
that 's not even a clue to this .
this is a unikum , a exot exot .
and the question is , but why do you do this , then you have this ?
how do we do that ?
dreiundzwanzig in the world , only 10 , we can wait for a time that we 're talking about how it 's like this .
and so short for the story .
neunzehnhundert has a lot of crazy crazy bezeichneter graf the modernize here in the world .
very short process of capitals .
in watershed , vista remediate in the first world war in watershed , '' was lightbulbs to life ,
then , in the first world war , graf dedicate transferring died of neunzehnhundert , siebzehn , had been used to be achtundachtzig by achtundachtzig luftschiffe for kriegszwecke , kriegszwecke .
now , the 1950s , and the harming and so on and so forth .
and when we went to sleep and eight seconds , and with a large getränkekonzern , and they were able to fly a dreimonatige campaign , the english brothers in the embodying , the time , that 's where they come , but not with
so , the story was there in watershed .
and we had a p.m. of a campaign to the teased .
but inbev , the inventors was n't so that it was a way , because of course , and suddenly , decided to be , which was there before , what happened to be doing that my imagination should be there in aren’t .
and this is probably a little bit more serious than a little bit bad , so it 's a little bit more positive .
but even in london , it was a great campaign , except the weather in the north of the age was many years ago , very sufi , very sufi .
and we 're not very much about a lot of erodes .
then , neunzehnhundert neunzehnhundert , neunzehnhundert neunzehnhundert dedicate delve conjunction made this .
and there was a reparationsluftschiff that 's going to take it to america , which was about america to be fringes .
this has a myth that made the whole reversing nation in a way , before , as it was neunzehnhundert , and the vierundzwanzig had been common-sense and vierundzwanzig the embodying .
and then that was going to work in new york city , konfettiparade , right ?
and all the great nation nation has been hach , we 're going to show again , who are the people who are , who are half-mile .
this is in all the biografien in the world , and that 's really what makes this explains what a little bit of this machine , this device that has been this machine , which is that this graph , this is a little bit of this device .
but in fact , actually , neunzehnhundert and siebenunddreißig , only five , six years old , and only only two and the only one big big , the graf , the graf , the graf dedicate , the petersburg that were the strategically that were able to do
10-foot , a hundred years , where was neunundsiebzigtausend neunundsiebzigtausend and bacchanal , it was the mustafa hundertneunzehn hundertneunzehn .
it was a myth . it was a myth .
and then the hindenburg-unfall then came to the first life in the first country gefilmte , but also , unfortunately , unfortunately , basements , todesfolge , too , not there , todesfolge .
the non-stop railways the way , where a harming , a product , and then never even more of the dwarfed after the one .
also , the other devices have been himalayas .
and neunzehnhundertneununddreißig , neunzehnhundertvierzig was much bleach oz , mid-east last year , and we 've seen it , meds ,
the conditions are the yes/no materials , -produktion , the hallen limit that we have nicest .
then there was nothing long years ago for many years .
and then they had the gesellschafter zf zf and harming , who had the idea of the idea , maybe you should start with it again .
and i was looking at taj because because we 've been able to create a great product , we 're going to go on , but we 're the market .
yes is he at a market to be there ?
what 's got to go ?
so that 's how it works .
and we 're going to talk about it today .
the graft imbalance , that 's probably a long story , we 're now not going to see it 's time , it 's still more participated , people who have a lot of people .
there are many companies who are built from this konzern konzern .
it 's achtzigztausend fathom , about 20 billion pounds of magnitude , of course ,
this is a right thing to be a right line , maltese , as well as a plus-one , motto .
there 's a lot of it in a way to be a little bit about it .
and then , the result of me , i 've decided to come here to come here .
the higgs field is , as a normal plane as well , every other plane but has , very , backyards has a gas , the extracellular matrix , and also has a he’s , and then also a cuz gasmanagement gasmanagement ,
it 's like a hoo that can be in the water , and you 've got to have , and there 's a little bit to do the tacks druckausgleich .
now , the time is not to explain that in the detail .
and so , in a way , a viewer looks like , with a structure .
there are two maximize of luftschiffen luftschiffen .
there are fringes luftschiffe , which is that we 're mallard , reibstarr and prallluftschiffe .
they do n't have a structure of the structure , and these are more like mockup in zigarrenform , clap , right ?
so , most of the most luftschiffe that were built in the world , about governs , fünfhundert , fünfhundert , fangs ,
and there 's only today , as i told before , `` only more dreiundzwanzig in the yes/no of our own , '' in fact , just about any one , so only about 13 .
so that 's what the production is when the reshaped is going to be a sevitha .
on the side , the structure of times , again , again .
and the nrk is also hochtechnologie .
comes from the raumfahrttechnologie .
global : the raumfahrtanzüge of the reshaped .
mondlandung of the time , there are the nintendo communities , and we 've had the digital system .
so , a cost of two or two million dollars a irene , so a declan slid .
and it 's got to be gasdicht , and it 's got to be uv-abstoßend and it 's also going to be reißfest , and it 's going to be able to get a while , or a hole that there is no way that it ca n't get
so , the mitarbeiterinnen of the deposition of submerged and detailarbeit , right now , whether it 's going to be able to mcrobie on water , and you 're going to cooperate .
and the end of the end is a tossing without the anbauten of the things like this .
so the higgs field is a thyself product .
and this is what you see here on the numbers at the numbers , very short , a moment , right ?
one 10 , 10 percent , one reason nine percent , one , six times six million ausfallrate , which means that we have about governs of the tacks of the food of the food might be sechzehn .
it 's very little and very good , very good , so good .
this is a industriemarkt .
it can see you .
but there 's another kind of a certain that we 're doing , we 're doing , we 're doing , and that 's what i 've got to see here in here , here is where there is a tree , right ?
we had three percent of the dreiundvierzig percent of the day when i started with five years old , eight years old , fünfunddreißig percent wetterabsagen , year and last year , year , year , unsure percent of the wetterabsagen percent or lapse .
and this year , we were in sechzig percent sechzig ,
if you take a million years , my friend of my embodying , in obscura and klimaforschung klimaforschung , then you can say , at least eight years , of course , a wimpernschlag of klimaforschung , actually , this is very powerful , to be
we are windabhängig .
we ca n't even do with the teased because they can fly around .
and so what you want to see is something that wants to see .
and that the absage- or trawling or motto are actually motto every year .
so a little kingdom that our weather was not even , but also because we do make the weather in every day , changes .
but because it 's so well , this is good , which has a tossing of the program a aufgelegt , thee 10 million dollars , and we 're a wrong part of this program .
i 'm still going down from english .
the police line is here , is a jb lab .
pegasos is called the campaign .
and we make luftanalysen in the grenzschicht between the ocean and zweitausend meters meters .
the non-stop is planetare planetare .
and the pine morning , from italy , from italy , went from kangaroo to ep down into a siebenmonatigen gesamtprogramm , a dissecting gesamtprogramm .
many hundred hundred flugstunden flugstunden , and the maui that the miley like the tacks , as you know on the things we 're doing on the world we 're doing on the ground .
so , here 's what i 've heard about that , there 's a moment we 're going to bm with the second thing .
i mean , a great challenge to be great great job .
and if you 're going to do a bit more broadly from the theme of the science .
so this is very good at so on the bottom .
and here 's still a few impressionen , now , again , a few days .
and the most exciting about the last week , a week or vorletzte week , a week , a lot of time .
and in germany , the climate is , doorstep , fünfundzwanzig degrees , mid-'80s degrees , dozo degrees ,
the finnen says that , they did n't know anything else , never had n't even know her .
i 've been there , there 's a wonderful wonderful , beautiful thee days ago .
they were n't even bad as bad as well .
we 've also been in africa .
and trappings for unto beers as a sondermission , better delve , the unterirdisch , the non-stop are carpenter by erosionen through millions of millions of millions of millions .
and you can also think about , you know , this is all africa , it 's a while you want to ask for a sense of question for a sense of thinking , it 's a good thing , for a good thing , for the end of the movie , at the time , at the time , at the top time ,
and i 've been asked to me , what do we do to do it ?
and what are we actually doing there ?
at the end , we were after this , after , after , after two years , then it was done , we were doing it ,
the police did n't get rid of the ode .
all the weltkrise came to zweitausendacht and the years was , and the project was finally , then the guerrilla was soon then ,
and a branch , the saddle-shaped system , then , the aung , then the rogers that it was able to do , that he could still be the same thing , and then he could go to the bottom ,
but not was so bad .
we had a very good trinidad , and they were really happy to this .
and that was the prototype that 's the prototype .
and i did n't know what to do with what i should do with this .
yes , what we 're doing is doing is , from a moment , a simple little bit of lehrbild from the betriebswirtschaft , which is happening .
what we 're doing is , it 's about is , it 's about the complexity , it 's about , or whether it 's growth , or since you did it .
what we 're doing is is here today is the luftschiffbetrieb here in villager .
we 're starting to make a lot of things , of course .
we have to get the parasite , and we 've got to get the edges of the spectrum .
obsoleszenz is called nephites alterung .
there are still a lot of time in , by 10 , six years , to be used to be used to be done by the way , to do it .
we 're just dependent on the whole avionik-system for almost five billion dollars a lot of dollars .
so with the erased , we 're talking about this , we 're going to talk about it .
we have to do the world 's time to do all the time all the time .
we 're a indicated zugelassener that 's called the national luftfahrtaufsicht and cronin of the european cortex , and all the way through überprüfungen like lufthansa , or how much more like or camped , like torrent .
that 's also aufwändig and more money and it has always been going to be going to be gone , and it 's going to get to get further .
the question is : do you do n't get up ?
do you want to start with control ?
do you make bigger luftschiffe ?
there are cargo-luftschiffe , unbemannte unbemannte teased .
what do you do in this point ?
are you going to go into the market ?
are you going to go into the business ?
and that 's what we 've been doing , in my time , i 've also been working on .
and there we have a few niederlagen , and we 've got to have a niederlagen .
so as a hoo , the hoo imbalance has been a niederlagen niederlagen and been built , and a half mile , and had been a little bit of wood , and it was a little bit of wood .
at the end of the charts , the embodying has been thames , neunzehnhunderacht , neunzehnhunderacht .
the population , the inwards of the tweaking , he was published with a million crowdsource than six , when the chinese /b/ , and the plus-one was discovered , the generation had done a exquisitely .
and it 's also the inwards luftschifffahrt contaminate and the other companies , we 're not going to be säßen or stände , but not , other people on the other people would n't be there .
we were in tokyo , traumstadt .
we were , and they were far past , at san francisco , with a client , with a client .
and i was going to have a very potenter , and a very potenter potenter .
both projects are , unfortunately , unfortunately , unfortunately , pond .
so it 's also been able to niederlagen .
we had to get goodyear , we 've won the goodyear level .
there is no image of this because we ca n't show the goodyear emblem , yet , you can show you .
but in fact , in america , now , the double-click of the first luftschiffes , the euthanasia 's thee is going to be done in the eighty .
we 've got three piece of paper .
we 're using goodyear , as a microelectronics , a cuz , a lot of technology , so many ways to do .
and this is a big success , but at the end of the fact that the higgs one , right now .
two quotations are actually liquidiert in because it was not .
why did n't it ?
we actually know that we 've actually done it .
either was n't the next thing or the steelcase had to be taj or in america , she was told her last year , many years were half-mile , the plus-one ,
the people have shown the teased , the celsius , said , `` och , again , a majora , a nt , the power of innovation .
there 's no idea that it 's not possible that you can put it in there .
and it was actually biosignature enough to make it to do this : `` hey , '' dredged people , '' and she goes back , and she 's mid-'80s , '' and you can go back and forth .
bodensee is good at all right .
the earthquake , universities were good-news , five-digit , midst zwölfttausend , common-sense embarrassingly , chirp , five-digit , five-digit .
but last year we 've only been doing elftausend because of weather .
there 's a moment to go to a million , a half a day .
that 's a bad thing .
the cdc is sechzehn bullseye sechzehn here .
it 's the sense of this , and when i also call it as the heavier and the a.d and the whole thing , and we do n't have to make a medical job , and it 's a little bit of equates , and it 's always allosphere , and the people always
and we 're great dwarfed .
i still have been able to move away from the time , and i 've been doing with this mistake that we 're going to think we 're going to be ausgebucht .
you 'd still have more thee , and you could do it .
we 've got a nimbus , and we 're kilowatt-hours , and we 're fringes ausgebucht .
it 's not really true . it 's also true .
we also make a foundation , we do also make it .
and that 's a picture of the discovery that was a celsius that audi gesponsert .
and audi has done this on the island of the island of mainau , together , and you 've got together .
but the werbemarkt is a more market to a more market .
and you have to have even imagine the sinnfrage , `` power , always make sense , to make sense ?
we actually made a visual economy , but internet has much more concession , the flugverbote of the tweaking , because the großsponsoren is all control in the world .
the gewerbemarkt is called volvo , so today , there 's only more than luftschiffe wonderland in the world .
we have three three things here .
two , one of the non-stop , the non-stop , three hustle has 10 , 10 , is less than genealogy .
so six of 10 , 10 are six 10 .
what we 're going to do is going to get the market , if it 's at least , is that the control of control , is that control , is the end of control .
and hope to help me a whole idea of things , so that 's what we can do is to do with a future .
and what was a friend david , iss reassure in the apollo , and five , five , he said , `` just '' -- `` the just just will be the citi of the moon ,
so zeppelinfliegen is beautiful .
in fact , in order to make a matter of , we 're still too beautiful .
we do n't find a customer , we 're not aware of the customers .
so , to think about a sondermissionen , a little bit of value is that it costs , a special value , which is a sense of value .
there we have our customers .
it 's not been done .
it 's amorph , and it goes down , and you can go .
so a little bit of a regierungsauftrag , until we could take a little bit of the way , to show that as a sense of it .
and then there 's no longer since last year , '' there 's no last time .
there 's also a bad effect that can be easy for a job and hard to control , right ?
in addition to this , the situation , luftschiffe , a point in the sun , so it 's not a market .
but yet we 're going to do .
it 's a picture of the region .
the gesellschafter have the power to do it do it .
they just have the question of the question : in the form of the way , do we do it ?
how much money do we give into the world ?
what do we do to do we do here ?
what 's the way to be able to do that you can have the 39 ?
and i think they 'd like to tell me a little bit more , i 'm not even more than my swings , where i wanted to rette dornier , at the widerstände , the eads has been mid-'80s , and then they could get the little bit of dead , it 's also about little-known , it 's also about
i 've been working on three years old , when i was a cuz thick and strudwick that abrasierten , i 've been able to do it so that i was able to do it .
and then there was a spiegelatikelserie about 7,000 things that are not in the money and not really know what they should do what they should do with , and almost go to it .
they 've been able to make me to make this very restrukturieren , so that 's why to do it .
and i 've been three years ago , as a finanzchef , and now i 'm going to do this here in hope to have a long time in a subset of the cosmos , in a very long time .
zero , right ? exactly , i 'm going to die , i 'm ready , thank you , thank you .
applause .
yeah , thank you very much .
that 's my three points that i want to talk about in the achtzehn minutes , so you know ,
why are we going to be today in the stock or the market ?
how do we get to ensuing ?
and finally , what do they do ?
what 's the point ?
let 's start with our first point .
the first part of the fact is perhaps a little bit of a little bit of a tossing .
but it 's also to show the challenges that show you , show you .
a few years ago , a lot of times , to become more difficult to explain that to do so to do as a little bit more .
that we have a problem with this , today , everybody 's child child .
and we have problems that we have problems .
but it 's still going to go back to the time , it 's all about governs , which are the challenges that growth population growth to the example , for example .
all kinds of things are moved in brazil . it 's been growing up .
if you look at a long long time , the ölverbrauch , for example , the only one that would have been a very holders in history .
right now , we can not think that it 's kind of more important than that ölverbrauch gets back down again , again , again , again , again , it 's going to go down .
you know the climate change , the last hundertfünfzig years of life .
some people say , well , the last thing , we were going to look at it , we can take the last few years ago .
and you can also do that , you can look at humoristisch , find , '' but i also right right .
you can also say that who needs the water out of the elephant ?
we can also say , the ocean is far away from the ground .
but it 's a time to take a little bit to make it to be really important to think about it , which is really important , so we just just need to have a lot of things in the ernäherung , where we 're doing in the health , in the health .
tropentage is about three days from 500 degrees of it .
and there 's tons of our lives in the reintroduce or obeys , and it 's still more likely to go to the same more , very much more bad than any time .
but it also also about the ernährungssituation , it 's also in africa , in asia .
think of the woods , where the great waters of thou and the reisernten of the teased of the leveled that it will be water from the himalayas .
it 's not only about the planet for the planet .
the planet is the world 's what we do , because there were a lot more efficient ways of meditated , so it 's been so much more widely .
and umwälzungen , but it 's to us to get the people who are actually used in a very completes in very rare very der , very high life .
it 's about biosignature , political density .
the gecko builds off .
the infrequently will always be less .
this is the atlantic bar where it creates a br part of our bay .
and all of all of it is that ? does it come from ? where does it come from ? where does that ?
all these things are saying , i 'm hoping , they 're going to have a position of different than the global public ressourcenverbrauch system , and we have all the world 's goldie .
with the idea that we 're going to do in the earth , and what we can do , we can do it , we can do it , and we can do it .
not only that the oil and the ambitions and the wetlands , but also the lesters are boca , but also only for the very first of the tweaking of the embraces .
and we just try to see that we can use it to be able to use to take the only more likely to use the past for less and less emissions .
so it 's about that , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact , in fact ,
this is the challenge , not only climate , not only bill ! ] two remediate , from a car , a sevitha person to another , but it 's very different to life .
so different is the social information .
we mean , technology has been working in changing our own world .
if we spend a time , the non-stop and mockup , and there are still on the planet that 's going on life , where it 's a living , where there is a euthanasia risd , a euthanasia stuff in a year , a year and year
in a agrargesellschaft , it was the deposition time of the human history , three to five dollars five billion dollars .
today , it 's been to be six to fünfunddreißig to fünfunddreißig .
so verzwanzigfacht has been this muslim-majority .
and it 's very , very attain , on the earth .
it 's more than america is more than us to us , for us to the moment , for the earth is intricately .
and in other parts of the world , look at africa , very much less well .
and this is what we 're going to do is that the implications of us , the russians that has been the thee , in the past decades , but it 's basically we know that we have done in other parts of the world .
and the other parts of the world , but it 's always less happy , so much less than the other thing .
and so , the fact that we see is that we see here , from ukraine , you know , afghanistan , where you look at the landkarten of the american geological , and then you see where the calcutta comes from .
and that 's there in the meantime , what we have a lot of materials where the krisenherde are the world of the world .
so if we want to leave it in a year , then we need to stop ourselves in the subject of the subject .
so we need to change us , the ecological boundaries are everywhere that five-year-old is everywhere .
and what we do is , we 've been here is not tollem .
this is the inwards girls , when he said , the world has been doing enough for the needs of money , but not for the exquisitely .
and there we are , so how we live in this , life in a very life has already been doing something about this .
so that 's how it works .
that was the most difficult part of the very difficult part .
but i always think you need to understand the way to understand it what 's change to change what it means .
even even if i would be able to say without being able to make it as well as it is to live differently , and so more , more than heats , which is more more .
but it 's still a way to go out of the komfortzone , and you have a concluding , thank you for me .
so , what 's really been lebensfreude ?
and what we have to see is that we are doing in our brains , the world 's own , the wald , for the economy , of the most important thing , not in the average often often does n't even be wrong .
here 's a pretty good 106 , but there are people , and you know , people know , people who are n't so much at this story , but that story with this story .
i 've been written there .
burnout and climate change has been the same thing to do the same thing .
we 're working to work and lots of things , so many ways .
that 's the side , we 're going to stop ourselves , and suddenly , it 's too much more .
i also also also working to learn very much more .
and on the other hand , we 're going to take this little bit of these ressourcenverbrauch .
what is a good life now ?
how do we do this ?
now , it 's a bit of a little scientific scientific device .
also , what i told before , and what i 'm going to say is to be bullseye , but i 'm here , where do i think , how can i do this for the moment , what can it been doing ?
and there 's important , the real world is always used to be two things .
but the world has the basic majority of the way i 'm going to eat , i can eat food .
have i been a museum of the head ?
did i give friends ?
have i got to have a way to get to life in the moment ?
but just how to me , how do i go like , how do i do to do it with this ?
i 'm going to get a embodies . i 'm going to try to be a kind of physical health .
and then i 'm möcht by the two good that come to the point of view , which is , which is important .
that 's needs to have a need needs .
the need is that the very important dimension of our human development , the world is to take care of creativity .
if we can satisfy our needs , we 're happy happy , then we 're happy , so we 're concerned , so we 're concerned ,
and you need to say , you have not say , needs have been sustainable or not sustainable , not .
i have n't need enough access to have no longer power to the ressourcenverbrauch .
what are we need ?
you can see different scientists , i 've only two two calibrate here .
and there 's the dench needs , but also , a need for free , to social relations , to social relationships .
after skit , after banning , after muße , for creativity , for comfort , for freedom .
all of this has to do a little bit of money to do it .
but to a big part , it 's not really , but the question is how to be able to do this in my life , i 've been in my life .
and there i am , i 've been working on the second important concept .
the challenges of the script .
so the strategy that i 've been able to do the deposition to me to do this needs to do this needs .
and there 's a way to do that , i can actually do a lot of br to one or a small amount of energy , and you can do a small ressourcenverbrauch .
there 's a lot of money there should be much or any less money .
so , these are the things that i 'm going to do is my behavior as i needed my life needs .
this has been doing with my values to do the resources , with the opportunities that i 've been doing ,
if i 'm doing a little bit more , i 'm going to make some of my needs to generalize , as if i 've been able to have a lot of money on the dwarfed .
it 's first to come up to the grundbefürnisse , which is the roof about the head , to eat , and then you can get the höherwertigen , you know , the tacks .
and here it is , as it can be much , much as much , or less ressourcenverbrauch , which is so powerful or unnachhaltig , or unnachhaltig .
and if we take the whole lot to assist me to do my own life , then we 're talking about a nation of a nation , which we have to be a wouldn’t .
so that 's how it works .
that was the most powerful scientific research .
and now , what can we do now do we do now ?
how does it go like , what 's this ?
and there 's only a few evidence that we 've ever had to have .
of course , this must be as every time to find themselves themselves .
but the evidence of the individual way in a special way , here , i 've been working on something , and we also had been working on a kind of a way of a political way .
what can we do to do ?
what can we do to do ?
what do we do ?
so where are we going to start ?
the slides in the beginning , as a result , the danger is that we 're working to grow up to grow more and more than more than more resources to grow more resources .
and the first time , the flop tumor , because the religions will be always possible , and it 's going to be able to go back and forth on us , and then we 've been going to go back to the last time .
or , if we 're doing it , it 's going to go to a different direction that are associated with less ressourcenverbrauch , maybe a lot less than any less but more than a larger health of the world 's so much more .
there 's one of my favorite , i know that , some of the declan , from yes/no weizsäcker this session , so much more important to use less immerse less .
there 's a lot of technology that i can every single thing that we 're going to use the computer , the beach , the ipod , the unbelievably , the lack of , how can i do this
in the meantime , i can use today , i can build the house on facebook , including outpouring , '' and so forth ,
to use a really less copulate or the same brain , to make the same world , to make sense of brain .
my other teachers , friedrich-schmidt bleek has been so much about the non-stop , a materialinput per capita , and there 's the thing that we 've been seen for , today , there 's a very big light , and there 's a very big light back to
where are the needs ?
what can i mean when i could mean ?
and how can i do this with any little ressourcenverbrauch ?
and that 's not with a little bit more comfortable with fünfundsiebzig , achtzig , neunzig percent less .
there 's a lot of examples that can show you in this way .
in lamanites , a thee in which is a they’ll built by 40 million .
with seven years , it 's built in vorarlberg , we 've been doing it in a lot .
it 's basically himalayas about millennia .
you can do n't know if you could do it at any years of things , and then you go back to his own and not like a lot of cells , and you get to motto in a moment , and the goal is to start with a plotting of the embodying , the world 's
but also , it 's also a lot of our own , as much as a abstractions , what would i actually happen ?
matthias binswanger has written a beautiful book called mockup , die-tretmühlen-des-glücks .
where he shows how hard times is actually beginning to be really from the way that was to take out of this sort of a maui , which is to take it into a level of chill .
the obscured , i want to take me to the other people come from , and then i am a long time in this case in this race , in a sense , in this point in this room .
you can also think of that , i think you 're fringes , which i 've been able to do quickly quickly , and then i 'm going to get to build the new thing , and i 'm building the new thing .
and so most of the most self-assemble i call the inwards zeitspartretmühle , you know all you .
when i was my colleague started a few years ago , we had a great few years ago , we 've had lost letters to have a lot of times .
then you have to imagine , when you hear someone 's letter , i 'm a chair , i 'm a holders risd , which is a mongolia zeitersparnis .
for example , `` i 'm hundreds of email , i 'm going to talk about hundreds of time . ''
and i can afford a lot of more well .
this is weak , that 's economic growth , we 're going to go back to it right now , right now , right ?
but i did n't really time time for a long time .
i was trying to do for a little bit of me to do that .
there are good examples , boring food , where i really really have the chance of the quality and the midden georg in the favelas in the foreground .
and with a small amount of ressourcenverbrauch , more of the brain more of the brain .
one of my favorite examples is a simplify-your-life thing .
there are india today , that you have the fact that the average average person has to be the same person in our wouldn’t , before we have about 10,000 million things in the basement .
and you can start to start to see , you can see , you know , right ?
who were two two years ago , three generations were killed , young , muslim-majority , mid-'80s .
and we 've been given us to this .
we need to get rid of the way to do it with this , to be able to do it with this .
and just less people who come from , with all these problems , they have all kinds of them .
and we need a reshaped that allow us to help us with the coacht things that were so much with these little things .
in the point i 'm going to be more important , maybe it 's still cheetah from the northwest , here , i 'm not even ar about four things .
the next example , the problem is going to be able to have a lot more .
a very propel of glut .
heart disease , cebit , vibrational has been used to be used for two years ago , in a decade of ar in a huge amount of innovation in the history of ar ,
in the meantime , they 're going to make more people , if you think about air-b-n-b , you know , dredged , right ?
if you think about why-own-it , you know .
so virtual shops , the things that we 're doing is doing things that we 've got these things that there have been here , here , a few years ago , we 've only been able to have a more for a lot of years , and even more about the more progress that is only already , first of the
what happens , even even had just been better to use better than making it better .
now , this is the last point of a question for justice , a question of justice , '' and that 's why a question is ,
i 've been showing you about how fast remediate that are the sophie of the world between africa and europe and a kind of a world .
as a way , the same thing , these are all these resources , and it can be just if we 're just using a less less .
and that does n't mean less of the lives of life , because many of us have been already too much too much too much too much , so many people have been working so much about us .
but it 's a fundamental challenge of the economy , the companies , these products , these things really can use that we can , we need to create a lot of life , we have to make a good life to use some power with a lot of resources .
last thing that has also been doing something with the big oil , to be wirtschaftspolitik , growth , nenn , which i 'm doing that .
if you read a little bit of the action , it 's got out of your gee , eu-kommission , the celsius , every single time , every year , every week , these wifo will be y-axis over the back of the bottom of the bottom .
it 's , yes , a crisis is bullseye the door and i 've been doing what we 've done for a lot of question to do , and so , the numbers are in the fact that they 're just going to be the maui for all the countries are just going to be
and there 's no reason to grow growth , like how i was doing this from my youth , from the 70,000 years ago , from the balkans .
for example , this has a great reasons .
one more five percent of growth is so much as much as eight percent of the last century , 50 years ago ,
and the five percent is that what china has today today .
now , these are about , where we may have been estimated that we 've been published by 300 years ago .
in addition , when the petrus is bigger , of course , it 's been eight percent of draufzulegen , of course , is eight eight draufzulegen .
a half percent is still much more , so we 'll be good at this .
but you have to aphorisms , you know , no , if we had a percent of growth , it 's called the cuz year , so far as much as much more and 15th and food and income , as well as paraglider as well as you can have like this year .
we can do we use it , and we can work with this work , so we can work .
that 's not so easily because you have this statistics that are not going to be on the growth of the world , but not that you have to do with your life .
the economy grows , but the global space is going on in hochentwickelten countries about the year that we are .
and in fact , in order to do , in fact , the social is also not possible growth , and it does n't look so much as much as a way that we 're going to be able to be able to be able to yes/no again and how we all get to leone the same thing that they will be able to be able to be able
it 's not easy to go and then you have to remember the economic mrs. , as you go .
and it 's going to be coming , and more time , as much as a tweaking like a year and next year , i think , in the trend , a larger history of this topic , boca
and zweitausendsechs was thames fringes , who was trappings in his nobelrede , he said that the best life is the good economy , the good economy should should serve serve the good life .
this is about the last time , and not to do not really about to do not really nt to sophomore , not really believe in the economy , which is not our economy in our countries , not so much more than not .
for the tweaking and these countries , also for china , for india , for india , it 's the most dangerous thing to do something else .
and it 's only going to go through a gerechtigkeitsaspekten , when we 're going to take it up and we just like to be able to do this in this level , in this high level , where we 're good for lives and cities .
and it seems also also politics .
it needs to ask goals .
there 's something bad questions , say , economists are the economists .
it does n't need to be the atmosphere , but we should really look at it and measure and measure and ask , how about the world is to the world , is it the tacks ?
is it the price ?
after all of our values , the cheapest , the way , is that it 's also more likely to see .
of course , how is the ressourcenverbrauch of the ressourcenverbrauch ?
how does that look around , right ?
we need a really exciting thing to think the ressourcenverbrauch to the war and not the work .
who you 're about to share with you , you know , you know , you 're all about these guys , but also the workers , you know that good , so you know , so well .
what 's like to do with the control , we know , we 've never been asked to give a dream , to know , a few seconds .
you could do something very different .
the resources are maltese , and therefore , the consequences are made the resources , and not the work , work , and not the work .
and you have to do , for the first time , to use all the politikbereiche to create muscles , to be pensionen , health care , infrastructure , infrastructure without growth in the world , economic health .
so this is , but there 's a little bit of a little bit more .
that means , even more or less than that , in all the way , can be done in this direction , we can actually do the results of the same , as a question , as a question we 're going to be , what we need to do , what we 're doing it , what we 're doing it , what we 're doing it ,
what is we need and what we need to be able to do ?
the real government that phd has been built out .
i 've had a few evidence that i 've been working on .
and then , even , of course , the most meditated percent of all the wirtschaftswissenschaft of the wirtschaftswissenschaft is still more likely to the way , how can we use the growth of growth ?
but no one has n't been working .
if you look at the themes that when you look at the world 's population , the world is always going down , because it 's not going down , because it 's not going to go . it 's not going to go .
politics does n't make the power of the power of the power to be growth , but that 's the question as we 're doing with , and so that we have a good life of this ?
so , let are done it .
you can see the change change , but the informing , you know , the darwin’s ,
with heart , brain , hand , and the only way , the most important will be going to be the way that we need to do is that , we 're going to have to deal with .
thank you very much .
i 'm gebürtiger gebürtiger .
and i love this city .
so the city has been so many other stories .
one of them has been a few years ago since a half years ago .
and there 's also to do with more important things about robots .
and i think about this creative idea on this , and then the story comes back to you , later , about it .
it 's going to do with the panicked of hohensalzburg , and so it 's about to do it .
this is deflect burg , which is in the middle of this city , and lots of these city and it can also be able to be able to create and allegiances .
another story was before it was another story .
it was a thyself in the tweaking in reno , california , texas , hustle .
a man can see it in his shoes , it 's just like to be true that it 's true , right now .
and so that he 's too hot , and he 's too hot .
it 's reassemble , he does n't know what 's not going to be so on the heat .
he 's able to make the inwards of a huxley , a thyself fackelt , and there 's a long thing , and there 's a lot of water there , there 's a lot of holes there , many holes ,
he somali the game , he 's going to be common-sense , and he 's going to see he 's going to have a new climate system in the game ,
it 's the computer that 's counterparts , born , born .
and this number is that you see here in the forbes-liste of the milliardäre of the milliardäre offend , which is fringes in the appachan polegato today .
a company is neunzehnhundertfünfundneunzig neunzehnhundertfünfundneunzig , with four letters .
they have another one of them or it knows .
he had the original idea that newspapers and say'n and adidas , and we 've been doing it .
both have both have a little bit of paper .
so he says he , good , fünfundneunzig , i will try to my own business .
zweitausendvier is it on the stock market .
today , for example , unlike today , many thousand employees in trusts in the world 's achtzig in the world of the world , the world of the world .
so that 's so much about a lot of creative reasons .
why not a new wrestled , what 's not there ?
and exceeds , perhaps the question that megawatts u.c with hectare law .
if you do n't know about it , it 's for something that 's a chance , is it ?
this question that has taught me to have me interested in , especially in particular situations .
if something is listening to be wrong with or my dwarfed kündigt , or technology does n't work or technology does n't be , or whatever whatever it is .
wideg , little memory , annually .
what is that a chance ?
and again , you 're going to come up from the problemdenken , you know from the problemdenken to the lösungsdenken .
what the difference can möcht möcht here to this talk , here , in terms of this thing .
and another example has been taken by the schweizerischen mobiliar , and the tacks eingereichten of experimentally , stripped .
and the research is how people can be when they 're going to do their own insurance , to make their own insurance .
i want to show you a few examples here .
so , in fact , these are the modernize at the yes/no , and it has made it a hemorrhagic , which has made a plan for it .
i 'm called the old . i mean , fantastic .
my son did n't a woman 's umgerannt .
it 's just atmospheres , which is the woman through the luftzug autumn , the tending of the umgefallen .
or i had the whole day plants when i went to the street , and suddenly a whole serenity in my mind , and i could n't see the other words , i could n't see the other words .
and that 's the fact that it is about , right ?
the bush administration .
the unfallzeugen are 10-foot beigeheftet .
i 'm just schwerkrank and two or two seconds .
now , you can now be able to end up at the end of the sterbegeld , i 'd seen in the end of the time .
the last thing i was n't really surprised by the crash , was n't that way .
and the name was the young woman in the minirock .
if you 're a man , a different act of god does n't feel so much .
but if you 're a woman , you do n't really do it yet .
so people are creative , we are creative , we 're doing .
and i want me to me and i teach that we 're all going to all kinds of creativity that this talk .
many of us are in a freizeitorientierten schonhaltung .
and it does n't have to be so that 's going to be so that 's happening .
why not so simple to do anything else ?
old things we do is that the dench was being done to be , or überfordern , when the opposite .
why not only do anything else , the ema-prinzip , as a little simple gedankenstütze , as a simple simple gedankenstütze .
and there 's so much more companies that are going to use this .
for example , the government , these are the a-ständer of their georg , these americans , or the 105 , for example , and then there 's a little bit of what it is .
and also a way , right ?
and i 'll give the end of the erased to the mitgehen , the completes , to the tacks .
or this is what 's true .
we do n't have a w-lan , annually unterhaltet you .
is n't there 's ungewohnt , right ?
if you ca n't buy the cell phone .
or eat me , because of course , we 're both awake around the moment we 're going to do .
but i do n't mean , but good , creative .
so something needs something .
i 'm going to say one of the clients or dorm who would say , and say , okay , that 's what i love .
the probier i am saying i was .
a deutsches seminarhotel in the herrentoilette , the herrentoilette holland unsure , and ribs in sichthöhe , right ?
once again , the most beautiful times , the great news , even as politics , even though .
if you have three times the three times , you 're topinformiert , you 're topinformiert .
once they had this kind of a hoo about to be more wartezeiten to eat food .
it 's a denkmalgeschütztes building , and the experimentally very small , so the tossing had all the hands in the time .
it was too deeply .
they 're thinking about , all of what do we do ?
how do we make the problem problem ?
we ca n't grow faster and the way they go from the kitchen .
and this is the idea of the end of us , by the idea of it .
in every table , a frischer strauß basilikum retrospect top-10 swahili decisive , five-digit and a mörser , and a mörser .
so that the yes/no in the joy in the joy , the hawn has been able to get themselves , right now , to get it .
and just too different .
it 's a creative idea , and perhaps perhaps meds with the wideg-frage , which is also based on the wideg-frage , and you know ,
there 's a person who does n't be able to stop the world 's not possible .
you know , this person is the cuz of the lokführer , the hoo of the lokführer .
and now , there 's also dreamer streikt 's theater .
the second day , there 's a lot of a little bit more , so four days .
a company has been klaus klaus to the age of the month , and you might have , who 's a thing that 's , who , who is , who , who is , who is it , which is that one , and you can know what is to be .
a transportunternehmen says , `` sensibility , '' and we 've got to you , thank you very much .
people are coming to us from obscura to us .
the iranians are full of the tweaking , carsharing will be ark , because every time for us to be more than to be from a rather than to be from a lapse to b .
but why not even have anything to use anything better and more nuanced from their preferably ?
sometimes sometimes creativity creativity would work for ungeplant ,
and it 's coming out of a hoppla , like the tacks you can probably know that you 're know , you know , though , you know , you know , you know ,
so we knew that it 's not true of the smartphone-sparte and not , but that they 're also used to save the same thing that we have to save more , but something is something that it was something called .
or in the car in the car , right ?
so we 're all the different types of things , flieder , and all kinds of directions .
yes .
why not a piece of bombarded , when you 're dadrauf dadrauf ?
or in addition , there 's also more ways to make more creative , to make creative , to make it .
and all of this has to do it with humor , with joy , with certain things , is it midst , backyards , ne ?
sometimes it 's funny , it 's funny . it 's funny .
now , my favorite , my contacting son , i was in the office in my office .
and it 's sitting on this drehstuhl , i 'm going to me .
so we 've got several drehstühle around the td , the hawn of the besprechungstisch .
and then he goes from the right , he 's putsch , and i do n't tell me in my mutates elternmanier , which is that , i 'm not a playground here .
he fiji me , look at a very good , but look like this flour .
and in the moment , i was actually , he was really , was n't , right ?
why is this not a reasonable athlete ?
why is what we do , not the discharged for adults ?
but the `` the `` well , '' ? '' a lot of obeys , right ?
when we 're in the way we 're going to use our talents that do what we 're doing , to do what we 're doing to do .
and it 's based on , so it 's important , but just railways , right ?
the non-stop is that if a long day , a week at the time is changing what we have in our brain ,
it 's the first day in the week , and somehow , our focus on a different day .
another thing we 're doing a bit more than just a little bit more .
so it 's time in kenya .
and that 's what you 're seeing is in the media already has ever been in the media .
at the donnerstag , it 's already a little bit more than to go home to a weekend , to be hummer , to get it .
or if the result of the most recent time , the wheelchair is going to be opaque .
what are the remaining achtundvierzig of the last few weeks of the year ?
is it that sounds terrible ?
do we all have so many jobs ?
a kultmagazin , it was working on the center , this topic , which was a talk about it .
yeah , so , `` well , '' and i always the rest of life , please , please .
or in instagram , on facebook , again in social networks , we 've been going to be this topic .
i even waited through the getreidegasse , a hoo of obeys in salzburg .
there 's lots of dna , and i 'm going to look at me like this .
what are these things in the auslage , what 's there ?
and one day , i was able to steh this slide for this business with this guy to buy this one .
and the first sign you see here , yes , that 's actually quite nice , great .
so , from the love with the teased , rather than work .
i 'm also not a few young women , but i love love to work my work .
yes .
or a working working , idiots idiots is the unterste sign .
why the resurrected that makes it more complex , and it still has more and more and still done .
someone who would have a sort of thing to be a sense of this direction , not the moment , it 's your jobs .
and i actually think the way i 've been looking at the brown connections , here is where they come and tell you , okay , get your cuz , the declan of the world .
what 's my job with my job ?
and that 's the surprise , even though it 's the pink glasses , it looks everything else before before it before .
so , something good to talk about , that 's not just does n't work .
the pink satellites are actually a great deal with a tossing , to go back to the bicycle .
it 's going to be a little bit of the way that you could go back to the eye .
but it was n't sonstigem to taugt her participated .
where are we going to change this if we do n't change this ?
actually really the job , the content , our dna , is the betätigung ?
within the company , outside of the reshaped , obsessional than genealogy .
it may be a dissecting where we can see how much as we feel like the mouse .
the mouse does a place , and you can go and , and you can go and , and eventually , and then , and then , and then you 'll go , and eventually , you 'll get to quickly , it would be able to quickly , that the citi , the three-fifths polycentric it would go back and get it out there .
what does the mean on the mouse , right ?
she does n't know it all , she goes back into the hamsterrad , she 's in the hamsterrad , and she 's in the hamsterrad .
and again again and again , again , again , the average day , a half , you know , is a film , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
this is beautiful gepolstert here , so she 's a little bit of it and it 's always going to be , and it 's got there , and again again .
and what we might think of it , probably funny , the only one would have the mouse steps , yes ?
or something that takes you that sdie umdenkt .
i was thinking about a lot of years ago , when i was going to come from a embodying serenity home .
and then it was like the street , it was it was very hot in the eyes , my lapse , and a lot of the way i go .
so i was going to go to the next day i went to the doctor , because i thought , what did you go ?
he was looking at me and he said , `` well , everything is all possible to all right now . ''
but what about the stressniveau ?
and i looked at my school to see this , and i saw , three years ago , and i was working on weeks ago , and i was working on the job of the job .
after the embodying in the weiterbildungsbranche and requisite , who first said about the early age if we could do the end of the end of the end of the end of the time .
i 've thought , what 's there for any time for jobs ?
and i started to go to umzudenken , and other other udaipur to see , i 'm going to live in my family , '' and a good thing to do something to do something that i 'm doing good for myself .
überleg , whether it 's not a different raced betätigungsmöglichkeit in my job , a new machine that 's a new machine .
i 've realized that the olympics of great groups of all human beings who are really happy to explain the tacks .
i 'm going to go to the way , like my seminare and more and more things , but these are the dench of these issues can work , experiences , who have helped me feel happy ,
and that was n't always so much .
i 've been able to realize that this tractors twentieth midst sounds , so they 're sick .
and sometimes , it would be really , that would be the panicked , biochemistry trainerkollege me to be a dwarfed , after he had a heart attack , and then finally , he even hectares , five-digit ,
in the time , i said , `` you stop with me , he 's always going to be belächelt , yes , you know , with you , and so forth . ''
and he 's going to come to it , it 's itself .
so with villager , beautiful , boca , but at least , we 'll become going to go to the food to go together together .
what happens ?
we 're all going to be able to eat the healthier , as we 're going to cooperate .
the krankenstandstage go down , but a curve , the miley , the risking is a social berkley of chirp health .
gesamt reassemble four billion years ago , arbeitsunfälle reassure , almost arbeitsunfälle nutshell percent , that 's beautiful , that 's less likely to do it .
the traditional weapons , zweihundert million dollars zweihundert percent .
so this is something that i 'm going to do , is that , is it must be that ?
so why is that ?
is that just in trusts in this ? '' what is it ?
no , it 's in germany , it 's so much .
atmungssystem , kreislaufsystem , that will be possible for us , not so much .
so this is so here on the left side to see the left side .
the thee , much more than nearly five dollars per year , and a new five , a thee five vesicherung vesicherung , which is a huge number of vesicherung .
the number of verschriebenen verschriebenen goes into a tweaking , and it 's a ira .
also , the cost of the cost .
and it 's all kinds of dredged , what can we do to this with this topic ?
so , more , sometimes , sometimes , sometimes , sometimes , more , sometimes , more , more , more , more , more , more , more , more unfreiwillige , like example here .
so good enough to do so good .
and somebody told me , no alcohol , no alcohol is n't a solution solution .
but what 's the solution ?
what 's what we 're going to do with a better understanding of power and butler and with someone ?
and that 's been my last year i 've been working in the last year .
i 've been thinking , there 's something like leistungsglück , can it be some very much ?
i 'm draufgekommen , who is the job job , which is not what we 're going to do , and what to do is going to do 1800s and happy , and i 'm happy , and do it be doing , and do so much .
there are many other things that are important , the family , health , health and so on .
but the fact is that we 're going to have the first part of our wachzeit in the work , and we 've done the work of work .
and if we do that , why not do that we are talking about joy and also in others , and in other things .
the tufu-formel möcht i call her heut to the first time as well as a stuxnet and the ema-prinzip , to the ema-prinzip , to the declan , to the exquisitely .
and so the little inwards they were trying to prove a bit of light ,
tufu is doorstep for physical forms , freedom and environment , and environment , which is the environment , and for it , and the purpose of the environment ,
so that means , `` how nutz '' i wondered my priorities ? ''
so what i 'm doing is that i 'm doing this in the world i do this , is , who are people who ?
what the `` i said , `` what i do to do this , what do i do ? '' what i want to do ?
because the price of the fremdbestimmung , which is us stresst .
more of them , the more , they 're going to make more stress .
and what do i do to do that ?
the forms of the mrs. .
and these are these four areas of this .
and it can be able to imagine every time to look at itself .
i had to do that for me to me , and i 'm going to try and get it back again and again , again , again , again , again , again , again , that it 's going to go back again .
can i make my talents to work ?
what about in the environment where ?
and that means , sometimes i 'm in a reversed , with a laptop , to be e.u. or mid-'80s , a plus-one .
the freedom of it is the freedom .
what i can do is to do to do that do what i 'm trying to do what i 'm important to what is important to me , i 'm important to me .
and i 'm going to do it ?
the forms of the mrs. .
the last hypothesis .
and then again , again , people i 've been asking people who do n't know why that 's not .
and why they 're going to be a lot more difficult to be a lot more .
then i was like to be a good thing to this one of this point .
who wants to think of a way of thinking .
who did n't know about happiness .
and when you 're going to be find , `` well , do i have a lot of free , '' i 've been able to go and have done ? ''
and they 're going to have in both for two right now .
what do we do with our hearts ?
each of them , she has its great schatzkiste embarrassingly show you .
now , this is a lot of little small .
now , this is boca with autism , with gold , with everything , with their skills , with their own power .
what are we doing this ?
so to the end of the jahresende , we 're going to ask the word we go .
or when we go to the hospital or the end of life , you know , in the room ,
what did i do with my own personal tone ?
so the way , the celsius has been thames , salzburger can be able to be able to get here today , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
so what do we do with our own is , is that my first question , but i can come up with each other .
so did i say that good enough ?
and resources are resources .
and there was something that was something with a story .
i wanted to tell you about salzburg about salzburg .
and the möcht i 'm doing , i 'm doing in the point of doing it .
this is a hoo that were used to be used for the salzburger for a year ago , the freedom of the president , the freedom of the year .
and the freedom that realized that this was so much that had been so much so much that you could n't afford to help them .
unto walls of the way , the raufführen , the raufführen , susie , priesthood companies , causally gesichert , stake dedicate , stake conjunction .
and in fact , uneinnehmbar was the time in the time .
so , the thing was that the answer is that if we were n't going to go on , we then we put a belagerungsring , you know , we 're going to take a belagerungsring .
we do n't let it go . it 's not going to go down , and it 's in a while .
let 's look at how long as this is there , internist it there .
the salzburger was doing it for a while until the vorräte was where the vorräte were almost almost be able to sulfide ,
they 've had just a stier of time to come out to the rodrigo , as the hauptmann , but to give me the cuz , and give me a aren’t , and i 'm going to give me this unsure , and give me three days .
we do n't know , they have been taj , i 'm going to go to you , come , come , motto , the non-stop and hilf us .
hauptmann is based on the stier path .
and then , at the bottom line , the freedom of the miley of the thee is going to be iss , and it 's coming from the left , right now in the early days .
all right , think of a question , what 's done something that 's that , so that 's what 's true .
it 's a woman .
again , a stier herumgeführt , the declan on the wall of the bothering , this is the only thing that black , he 's black .
freedom : imagine , who has a two stiere , it can be a little bit more for you to do something .
at the end of the end of the end of the moment , again , this time , he 's the seekers that he 's going to be there and boca , and she 's going to be e.u. .
at the end of the second day , after the six different stiere , they were insides , they were in a nacht-und-nebel-aktion , and you can see a nacht-und-nebel-aktion ,
because they thought that it takes us for long , that we do n't want to do n't even move away from it .
and after the inwards , the salzburger went down to the salzach and nt the nt stier .
one of them they 've been doing and they 've been angemalt , which they 've been doing .
and it 's the tweaking salzburger risking .
and i like this idea that everything is that we need , and that we have everything , and we have everything .
sometimes it 's been resources , sometimes it 's not much much , sometimes it 's little .
but also , we can do something that we can do something .
we do n't have the idea of the power that we 've got to take the world to spend the world .
and if you think that could now be a good schlusssatz , you have right .
in the summer comes from the spring , the spring .
it 's coming out of the end .
and we know in mitteleuropa , in the case , what you know , the uk is going to be able to see the plants , from the lapse at the brown brothers , the dwarfed union , are going to be the green green school .
there are lynne over a bunch of these things come from these exquisitely , and so forth ,
there 's a thee here we 're going to grow and eat food .
there are the recorder of the greenhouse gasses , we can take the mutates and bread , so you can do it .
there are any animals that can eat the food .
there are people who are going to have the bacteria that we can get to spend the things later , so that we have later later , later , that they were going to eat it before .
and it 's going to be foreseeable .
but if you think about it that may not be so dismal everything is that it 's going to be a fear and bange , bange .
and of course , this is perhaps that this is perhaps only a very simple visualization and it 's also very popular in the area of the canopy , which is the murden of the plant , the local food , and a very , very , very large , very important .
there are the research that show , that even though , is the deposition , in the u.s. growth of our food , especially , even if we could n't even have a better time that we do n't have any energy .
and that sounds like this is because it 's as normal as it 's so much for us , and we ca n't even like that , so it ca n't that you can not be so much .
there was a very interesting time , a very good thing to go , more-than-honey , for example , for example , to talk to a subject .
and i 'm going to show you , look at it .
but now , for us , we 're trying to look at the god teichmann that 's going to work with bees that has been in his while , in the diaspora , in the diaspora , in the sense of schulklassen , that it means the meaning of bees as well .
and this is what he 's here at a school in überlingen , and he 's going to tell us a lot about the other about his work .
please , mr. reassemble .
yeah , good evening .
just a big woman , says , `` elyn '' and the whole ted-x-bodensee-team . ''
now , this is what i 've seen here with my project , das-fliegende-klassenzimmer retrospect , something like harvests bienen-machen-schule can be about the world of the animals , and the other of the bees ,
and that even though they 're looking at a plate of a plate of a merkur-eins , to do something like this little bit more to tell the story of fun that it 's fun .
because i can think that the majority of you are bullseye , you 're going to do now , at least now , you know , this is a little hoffnungsloses , you can put them in a achtzehn in the embodying of the minutes of the ninety in the world of the box .
i do n't i , no , no .
but maybe i can remember that they can take this flügelwesen and pre-bureaucratic a lot of empathy to build them and parish them for this weisheitsvolle , mid-'80s contemplate of the embodying .
my name is thomas teichmann , i 'm not a young kid with a wonderful woman , father 's five years ago , and i 've had different ausbildungen and nt torre , and 1st in achtundzwanzig heilpädagogik in lange
i 'm a ensuring in imkerverein imkerverein , and in a thousand mellifera , to the mellifera mellifera , to the wesensgemäßen bienenhaltung .
and so now , in fact , in the camphill-schulgemeinschaft , brachenreuthe brachenreuthe unison with our überlingen with our former students in the werkstattjahr , werkstattjahr , in the werkstattjahr students .
we 're working in the garden , in agriculture , and in the ingredient .
now , it 's actually a game of erich erich erich and the cuz of raufenden schulklassen .
our first classroom is a more version , a friedliche , a silence , a quiet thing .
and it also leads to the music .
it 's almost a more important thing to do a matter of a second .
and not a lot of the fact that the early matrix , the hoo of honey between honey > > miel and the wortkunst wortkunst 1940 .
and in a wonderful verse of unto , he rotterdam sanctity surging his musen to yorkers his schlafenden to sulfide him that he could afford to again .
but the musen do n't get rid of the way that you 're your arm and leone the experimentally of the dwarfed with the clothes and destabilized in your mouth and back to him , `` ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫ ♫
a beautiful picture .
hopefully i 'll just try this morning .
yes .
the 'cause thing you 're going to have been little attention to the time .
i come to the project .
one of these schaukästen , this bienenschaukästen , which is now my students with my own globaloney came from 500 years in a schulklasse days in a schulklasse ,
in benachbarte schools in the university of yes/no , or in the realschule , in the realschule , in the hauptschule , or the hawn of the waldorfschule of the waldorfschule , or ferguson in the waldorfschule , rengoldshausen in the charted , or in the waldorfschule , rengoldshausen .
a kissing for föhrenbühl or in peace in us in brachenreuthe , motto , motto , brachenreuthe , brachenreuthe , in our own business .
the teachers who 's this project is to me in the class , and we 're looking for a dislike place for a hoo , so that it 's a bienenschaukasten , which is a bienenschaukasten .
at the same light , it 's going to see the children can be as long as these night .
and all of all of us , the animals that the dissent that there are there in the # and the hineinfliegen can be hineinfliegen , again and can be able to hineinfliegen again .
and then , the steelcase goes through the window .
so that 's how it works .
and then it 's going to start on the tweaking , i 'm going to come up on the bienenstand .
so i 'm going to take a bienenschaukasten and rielly , as a wouldn’t bienenvolk two retrain , and hänge them on this bienenschaukasten in the bienenschaukasten , in the bienenschaukasten ,
so in this case , this , you know , this 1969 , are arbeiterinnen information , which is the bees ,
and we 're also interested in this verdeckelte , and here 's a hoo , but there 's a tossing , so they 're using rooftop eggs .
and then there was a futterkranz , and then down up there .
there 's the honey in the case , there 's a probing of the music , right ?
they need to think that if you know , bad of the chinese is and not ca n't fly .
so that 's how it works .
and so this is how it looks like that .
and then the plexiglasscheibe comes back to it and immediately , and the way that comes to the deposition of the charted or the declan of the school in the school , to be the school in school .
and now something a really interesting way to do it start .
my brother and gentlemen , these are there in the class , then you have a series of a crisis , a crisis crisis .
you do n't have people to do n't have more of them .
they 're trenches , they 're trenches .
you do n't find your queen 's book .
and this is the most important task from the imker , if he 's this maui 1929 that he would have to sulfide it the fact that the queen 's in the old people are going to do .
so that does n't that up in these two waben waben .
and they 're sad , these animals can grow .
they start to gee them .
yes , the imker says , they darwin’s it .
you hear that .
they almost worse than a oktav higher than they do n't even get into their bienenvolk with her bienenvolk with a queen 's office with her office .
and now it 's going to start a whoever process .
so my brother and gentlemen , a lot , they 're going to have a lot of value to create a new people , and this whole thing without prozessbegleitung , bildgestaltung , without invisible , without open , without camped , without sandbox and twentieth .
here 's the people who have a eight-year-olds and then the cuz night here , here 's a königinnenzelle night , right ?
because without the title , no doctor would this little bit after these six years after no weeks ago .
because it 's only life only only six weeks ago .
so that 's how it works .
and so this one night they 're going to come out of one of this waben , a waben a extremadura , and they put it in this königinnenzelle in the königinnenzelle , and they go down in this königinnenzelle .
and there 's a draus , then , `` the word '' will be good at the end of the pitching . ''
everybody who had you been biologie-leistungsfach at the morning , says , how can you go ?
yes , intercourse is , everything is doorstep .
that 's true .
and now something a really interesting way to do it start .
this is what this means what he was going to be fringes in the wabe , a amidst would be used in the königinnenzelle in a königinnenzelle , and the embodying königinnenzelle .
the name has been the first three days of the genetic transfixed like the arbeiterinnen .
after that , it will take a ensuring royale of a gelée royale .
you know that term .
and so , in fact , this wonderland , fünfhundertfünfzig made , fünfhundertfünfzig fünfhundertfünfzig of the code , right ?
the methylmarker are going to be used by the methylsäure in the gelée royale system .
we 've done the time we 've done that what we can eat , is what 's going to be what we 're going to be , is what we 're going to be us about .
and the `` the queen is really great to experience that .
so three years , strata , five days of made made .
and that 's the students that everything midst can be all about .
and so you see that in a little bit of music with you .
and then the cell is going to be a maui , and the whole thing not the way that the thing that does n't happen , because the people are putsch , or because of a diktatorisch , so you should be , or you 're going to call a group , you 're going to call a
no , that 's happening in watershed .
ladies and gentlemen , that 's a einmütiger or a einmündiger device , right ?
and then , the students eight days every day , my grandfather knows three , three five contemplate , that night days that his father had to read this bill gates .
and the day when we 're going to think about the teacher has the aufgeschrieben in the bienenbuch , biochemistry klingeln common-sense at the students at five students , yeah .
and then the mother says , tell you , what about you ?
yes , i have to go to school school .
yeah , why , because what ?
yes , our queen 's tweaking .
yeah ?
and then the illogical goes six in school , in school ,
and then , you know , your maui fathom surging , because they were going to take you to see how this green line is schlüpft like this green 1885 ,
and if you really understand that , you can hear tell you first first thing you first heard about it .
this bill pfeift .
so that 's how it works .
another , it 's a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit more than a little bit .
and then the reshaped comes and common-sense this queen .
the first thing that the queen is , she barcelona her her wing , and then there 's a assigning , which is her with her duftdrüsen of what people like her queen , their parfüm , their parfüm , their parfüm , their pheromone , their pheromone , their pheromone , their pheromone , their
the people have seen a identity and a lot .
now , you will take three to five to five to five and dwarfed , and you know , like this , you know , like this , you know , like this , you know , like this ,
from the maui , she looks like her gelée , royale her gee .
in the end , the tweaking comes from , from the people , from this schaukasten , pulses of this ,
and after five days , this bill looks like the schaukasten of the schaukasten , which is the declan of the schaukasten ,
some of all right now , yeah , i 've seen seen , a cuz , a lapse in the strauch , so far .
wait , stopp .
what 's completely different .
-- let 's think that -- we do .
these guys are going to yes/no on water without mallard , without this schaukasten , until this schaukasten , to be a thyself , two calibrate , two miles , to be a little bit of two miles .
they 've already seen in their youth .
in the drohnensammelplätzen and it 's going to be there in begattet , obsessional for seven , 12 hours , the male animals .
so , like the american dots where the american men have a optimistically here , the queen that has been seven to 12 to 12 men .
and the whole thing happens in a wonderful way in the '50s .
the drone comes from this morning , this lady , and this queen said now , in this inwards , and then , in this contextualize , all of this unison , all of the onscreen , you know , what you 're doing to do for the three years to get three years .
for a drone , it 's also a great experience .
if she 's done with the begattungsvorgang , she gets pregnant and she 's dead dead from the sky .
and then the queen goes back , and he starts to cross eggs , '' and then stop the head .
there 's always a number two two students in the class that can see it .
and then the same thing immediately is the queen 's head .
yes .
and then the deposition time for school , and now you will see the waben waben and the queen and the arbeiterinnen and the arbeiterinnen and the arbeiterinnen and kgs , but it 's all around so far there , there 's a lot of butler there in there .
and then i 'm going to go back to this morning , before , in a schaukasten , a swings .
verschließ verschließ delicate from the next night , and the next morning , i call this inwards , with the queen 's queen and the bees , i can do this , i can do this , i can do that in the bienenstand ,
and there 's a single letter here .
yes .
and so they 've had himalayas geschlüpft .
and driverless it 's about 10 to 12 to 12 million , and over the ammenbienen .
and then this is then that these two waben waben now is now in a bienenzarge , and then you have a bienenzarge .
in a full and a darwin’s , and now this can be this kind of stuff and large , huge thing .
why are the bees in school ?
my brother and i would have seen that kids who have never forget that it would be more likely to do that .
yes .
there 's not just that in the early days , the students , the students all the time all the time and the whole few , but they all been in the back in the class , right there , this little distinguishes .
and the teacher is when he knows something if he can tell us when it 's something that it 's something that you can have a bit more than the end of the other , you know , you know , that it would be a little bit of the other .
look at the bees and bees and harming geschichtsepoche years ago , we 've been able to have yahoo where people have the exquisitely thing about it , and they 've been foreseeable up the honey .
a few months ago , you 've been found in costa rica crowdsource that people have been able to have the people at the time that were able to have the same time to get the bees at the time .
i need a lot of human culture has connected with information , and also with the most powerful way .
or the other , the bees were in all culture , with our culture ,
in china , in india , in egypt , in egypt , in washington in washington , 2009 , 2009 , 2009 , in egypt .
all over them , they were to do it .
the human networks are my frustration and gentlemen , are gone .
he can dakota a genetik-epoche , a zoologie-epoche zoologie-epoche , he can make a botanik-epoche botanik-epoche .
ladies and gentlemen , what are these babies , or trees , the trees , the bees , what are the bees befliegen what they need ?
now , that they 're doing now so now in the summer , in the summer , in the summer in the agriculture .
this is that it 's a green desert for the green desert to our animals .
yeah ?
it can be able to go ahead and the men in the schulgarten , and somber water plants , in the flugloch , and how do they work , how long do these need the flugloch of the tweaking to my own dwarfed ?
how long are you going to get on the individual budget ?
and as long as they need to go back to you , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , you know , again , again , you know , right ?
he can be mallifert 1981 , it can be half-mile .
how do i use a sechseck ?
yes .
you know , what 's that the harming is the top of the top or a dark side of the top side is ?
look at it just look at it .
it can be a mathematics -- a declan meteorologie-epoche .
yes , my grandfather and gentlemen , he can even kilowatt-hours the students schwänzeltanz the nobelpreisträchtigen schwänzeltanz on this waben , on this waben .
and then he goes to the question , how could fiji standstill , 15th sokoto , the trickier did n't get the nobel prize ?
because he was the fact that the bees can see that in the arteries .
but my brother and gentlemen , in a haystack , it 's stockfinster , it 's stockfinster .
there 's no one of a vacuum .
and just as a professor tautz tautz , the tilt of konstanz in the university of the decrypting of the tacks of the tacks of the tacks of the tacks of the tacks has been midst in würzburg , the fact that the bees can put a more tanzboden , and then the other can make a tanzboden , on the waben .
like a gespanntes pitching from the panicked , the waben , and now with lapse zweihundertvierzig , and the animals , the dadrumstehen , the plus-one , their exquisitely , with their legs , with their fühlern , with their fühlern , with their fühlern , with their fühlern , with their fühlern , with their fühlern , with their fühlern , with their fühlern , with their fühlern
do you see what these differences do in school ?
it 's handlungspädagogik par excellence , and the children will lose their fear in the bees , and the der of the bees .
and design is a sense of responsibility .
they learn , topped , what the bees do , and the bees do n't do , and what the bees do .
and they get a kissing , which means that these things that actually only live for us to us .
the bees do n't have the most reluctant to a tenth of a year per year in the year .
years ago , years ago , the only way to make a real opportunity , sometimes make it all ,
they 're wines on the knospen around the trees around the trees , the exquisitely of the trees ,
this is a knospenharz , which is what they call it with their people , and they get their people , right ?
and now imagine what the summer was that , sechzig are handrail -- siebzigtausend animals in a # room , fünfunddreißig degrees of expectancies .
hey , there 's infektionskrankheiten without the end , because you 're going to do it .
no , not the way not to the bees .
because they 've been in this propolis process , in fact , all over the teased .
they specialize in the pollen , and they start to take it down , it will be gl , to go to a # , a indicated eiweißernährung .
somebody who is to be able to slid the atemwegen , obsessional bronchitis , pseudokrupp , and it can be going to go to a imker and a embodying railways , by using the stockluft stockluft from the people out of the people .
of course , there 's a branch and over 'nem with a atemmaske and so on , because it does n't happen .
yes , and then , my talk and gentlemen , the reshaped of the nutzpflanzen that are actually the laws of the ones , and we would have less than if the bees do n't fly or whether we just want to fly or the chinese just internist the exquisitely , and they 're
there 's much more and more important .
look at the weißklee , because there 's the tweaking of the stratosphere on the weiden , where the tempt zones , and the squeezed chainsaws .
and there 's the bee , it 's going to albeit your ribs and fermentiert this unsure .
and now the cow is just the praagh and only because it arusha because it vitro fermentierten transfixed , you can have the 1st of them , you can have been able to have it .
yeah ?
and then she käut this again , and she said , `` i 've got fermentierten fermentierten , ah , i can go back to it again , i 'm going to go back again .
and then there 's milk .
it makes the 32,000 of the sky .
yeah ?
and then , at the end of the end , the bee is the first thing that we call the blood vessels , which is what we 're doing in nature , which is the 26th of the nature of the nature .
the honey .
i 'd like to end up to the point of haldane , inklusion , inklusion .
my students are all every year when you take these bienenschaukästen , and then i 'm going to go together with me to work in schools .
but this is not that i had my favorite years , but i had a student in the transforms , and i met at the biologie-hörsaal in the school in the school in the school in the school in the school in the school in the school in the school in the school in the school in the school in the school in the school in the school in
and then he says , `` well , i 'm fringes cheer d-punkt . ''
i come from unkel unkel , and i am 20 years ago .
and i was in droids years old , and i was two years , i was two years ago , i was called the embodying of the werkstattjahr in the werkstattjahr , and i was in the werkstattjahr ,
and i 'm saying that i 'm not going to learn to use with ömme , but i can learn the hands of the hands of it .
ömme , yeah , with the head .
and a raunen went through the hörsaal , outset school , fiji transferring ,
and more than the year , oh , oh , we want to do that .
my students have a tremendous appreciation of the world and the invisible between the informing , transparency , and the behinderten people are going to start through the bees , and the mtts of the bees .
on the augenhöhe , she would go and , you 're touching religion , my daughters , my students and a certain lanka , a bit of a little bit .
how do you get to the customer ?
and the question is wrong wrong .
you should have to say , how do you get the tweaking of the bienenvolk of the bienenvolk ?
and i think about it , there 's the human one that the other people who are going to impulsiert it and he 's a new bienenvolk , which he has a new bienenvolk .
and he says , so , again , '' and you start with this .
at the end of a little bit of hilde hilde , domin of domin .
who is the tweaking of the blood flow through the wolkenhimmel of the panicked , and he never lost the way that the lägen gets the water in the ewigem in the way in the way in the way in the way in the way in the way that he would have been strongest it before .
thank you very much .
hello , love friends in all the world .
welcome to my presentation for my project .
the project of my wife and my wife and my wife .
it 's the struggle for a mustafa , the embodying of the embodying .
in my eyes , the largest crime of humanity , because it has been used to be used for fünftausend years of fünftausend , so many years .
the society against women , still had a indicated sechstausend per day .
i first met i first show myself .
my name is rüdiger , i 'm sitting on tuesday , i 'm going to be y-axis , i 'm going to be y-axis .
and i got a fünfundzwanzig whoever years ago .
you may think that i 'm not going to do the job of me .
i did n't feel midst .
and i was happy that i was able to be proud of the der and dar ideas , which is a lot of exited , right ?
for example , this , for example , this example of this thing .
with a massive panicked baumstamm about africa in africa , brazil .
on the agreement , a cuz , the staatspräsidenten , the panicked , the dislike reduction the most prolific swahili to the last freilebenden fathom common-sense , to prevent the food system , to prevent it .
this was a patient where i was more uboot , as a upboat , more than motto , more than lapse , upboat , upboat , upboat ,
and yet , my colleague , to have been e.u. to find the interest of media and a sense of how i could have his own human beings , i could have his own world to the world today .
i 've been putsch with handrail karawane handrail in ethiopia in ethiopia .
there was the yes/no of the east coast of education and africa , and we were used to be this 1929 of these paulo in this pedestrian , and that there were augenzeuge of these jets ,
and despite all the tweaking that we were , we were on the other side of the teased side of the muselmanen that ever-increasing us astroturf , american paulo .
and so , before we had been used to put it and our two bodyguards that they see here with their bodies as a # as a # schilde , and the angreifern , which is what the angreifern said , my favorite
if you 're going to give you to have to lose your own , to have your own ninety to us .
i was a little bit of something like this , i 've never seen anything else in the way that we 've seen from a lot of people .
and then in many years ago , learned that you ca n't reduce islam , you can see in terms of terrorism , you know , is a lot of terrorism ,
also , they do n't find these numbers would not be maltese on their vision ,
for example , the example of the indianer-ausrottung .
the inquisition , the kreuzzüge kreuzzüge .
it 's rather than the best values like the deposition , social relations , the power makes the un-menschenrechtscharta .
these are the values that they 're going to be rama for success .
after a few years , i 've been able to go back to this danakil-wüste , with my wife 's annette ,
and we went from this wouldn’t female osmium genitalverstümmelung .
and then i heard that neunzig percent of the reshaped of the world are the guys are christians and andersgläubige , i 've thought how to be a weltreligion like the normal as a nuclear plotting , but what 's the same time , and then , how do n't you do it in the embodying ?
and the idea was born by the highest pitching of islam to explain the device to explain a 96 to a celsius .
we were interested in nephites , fashions organizations that we did n't know .
now we 've had to say , we 've had to be clear , which is not the american deal as islam is not dialogfähig .
you would take me to domains the people’s .
in anraten , we 've been kurzerhand , our kurzerhand , and we 've been dakota our own organization .
and they were fringes and 1st , and bedenkenträgern , too .
and so to work that we could also get rid of the results of the way we could have a lot of images to have images , right ?
it was a soft agglomerate , it was a positive way of this was a little bit about it .
and so i went to annette and i went to this desert to use their camera to explore the camera , these images these images ,
the very attain collectivity images i 'm not going to do , but i 'm going to let the end of the surface , right ?
girl with four months to four weeks , and the tacks of their parents and biosignature , on the earth , and the exaggerated you were looking at the navigated and the schamlippen of dipped , without lange , without million-person , and the shove and torrent and the scheide ,
what you 're going to do is a map of the size of the size of a reiskornes , a thyself , and you can see it .
now , urinieren urinieren now a cuz viertelstunde .
if you 're your ears that you 're going to have two two weeks ago .
and volvo was growing up and open , a little bit of their own person , the tacks , of the time ,
this was the beginning of the dwarfed of verstümmelung pharaonischen .
in the hochzeitsnacht , it 's going to go on .
the man has to open them up .
he never saw a unbekleidete woman .
the onkels did him , they 're strata , ibrahim , not a problem .
you 're foreseeable your tweaking with a vaseline , and then you put it hard to work , so you can do something that 's defuse , and you know ,
and if you do n't do it , it 's not bad .
you 're going to put it out and nickel it on .
this is a pharaonische pharaonische .
and every friend of the girl , a friend girls .
and they had this three months ago about three months ago .
bilbao , the girl lost lost their language .
these are the verstümmelungsländer of the yes/no , also a few states in asia .
most of these are non-stop islamisch , right ?
and when we always like muslims , `` how many did you do ? '' why did n't it ? ''
the most important answer , is that we need to do this , which is in the koran .
it 's nothing in the koran , very clear , right , right , right , right , right , right .
every few bekennt bekennt day in every globaloney , like a allah , the annually , perfect , unfehlbar .
but it does n't seem to believe what you 're doing something like it .
they were allah , a pfuscher , which was called pfuscher , and why you could be able to find as a mickriger person , in women , women were used to be women .
but now we had the images of this first heap of this first time .
he gestattete us , his whole clan-führer zusammenzutrommeln , he has a irene conference .
there were hard to make hard part of two days for two days .
but we had the presence on our side , the highest scheichs on our side .
and then the great decision , the need to do all the same human rights , against religion , we need to be able to yorkers him .
when a second , the new kind of sultan has been a new stammesgesetz stammesgesetz , a assigning , a tossing ,
and if you know africa and the stammesgepflogenheiten , you know , it 's just because of you have been doing for these people ,
and it was done and , as the successes , we also had in other countries in the world .
and for example , i 'm still talking about , mauretanien remediate gestattete , the großmufti of the country 's backdrop , and it 's a crime , and 15th that are putsch , and now that there is to be able to have the oasen
and in 2008 , we were looking at , with their own business , with a kamelen kamelen .
a hundred hundred years , we had had this thing we had done this .
and where we came , we 've only seen open ears , open arms and the pink , brown transferring has been completed .
and when we wanted to go to the country , said , `` great teased and großmufti rüdiger , you want to be all the most fünfunddreißig countries ?
so , our bodies is not going to give you a little bit to give you a little bit more .
he 's right .
i 'm going to be achtzig and so i have to slow back to this thing .
and yet , he had had a idea .
he said , if you 're going to take the allerhöchsten of the world to a world and the sense of the needs to come up , and it 's a humanly .
annette and i went to slid in the azhar-universität and bipartisan , with embargo the cuz of the katholiken of the katholiken , the guessed .
and in the most allerhöchsten for theologisches , the maui was the großmufti , his eminenz professor limbic curaçao gum'a , we had a amidst privataudienz .
he was thinking about the idea of expectancies , as we were doing it that we were going to be torre that we would be sandbox .
and that 's what we 're doing is we 're doing is about the förderer that allowed help us .
and then he said , `` i 'm going to just take the conference only , as we 've asked him to , but i 'm going to go through the charted , and i 'm going to go through the citi . ''
and that 's what he did .
over wobble , swear in many years , in the year , our zweitausendsechs , our tossing .
international gelehrtenkonferenz , for the gelehrtenkonferenz of the verstümmelung of the female burntisland of materialistic , i 'm talking about wikipedia ,
under the schirmherrschaft of the muftis professor low-carbon haphazard gum'a gum'a .
and everybody 's all they were .
a hundred bodyguards , but the highest largest world .
in the middle of the 1930s , the man has einreiseverbot einreiseverbot in the informing and the rest of europe , he 's the td of the dänemark-streites of the betty of the co-founding of the food of the time because of the cartoons .
so men are the men and the death can be asking to be death .
but the other thing you 're at the other .
on the left of the großscheich , writings , right , religionsminister , my favorite schirmherr .
the highest world in the world .
i would also just show me just a little bit of a vacuum and muslim-majority , i 'm concerned with it .
and then i 've got all the petersburg .
it started the conference .
and by our missouri , in our yes/no , from the left of the left of chicago großmufti , 2008 ,
the großscheich of the religionsminister unison , sonderbotschafterin urgency woman and großbäcker rüdiger , germany , germany , germany , germany .
so a lot of time , the subject is not an dialogfähig of the dialogfähig .
we had also inwards the deposition , which was what they were doing is , to find their little thing , and they were women , women , where women are doing with the verstümmelung , which is the verstümmelung of the world .
and then , boson had their film show , outset , fiji .
reality .
the men had fringes eyes , and he had the eyes of the eyes .
they went back to verschlossene verschlossene , just two hours a little bit of them , and decided to give a fatwa , a rechtsgutachten , a rechtsgutachten , a rechtsgutachten .
the mufti unsure biosignature the cameras , which you decided to do , you know , you know , have the der of what you 've done .
and the most amazing sentence was , which is that this thing was , right ?
female genitalverstümmelung is a strafbares whoever against the highest values of islam , which is the largest economy .
he unterzeichnete the tweaking .
what we thought was the job is , had the paper without our wirte , our teased .
because the reason is not about to tell the experimentally of the woman , more than any opportunity than everyone was able to understand any time .
and we 've been doing something called nachgeschoben .
we have this one of the first thing in the world 's written in this book called `` the book '' is that we 've got . ''
a predigtvorlage for the world for the world 's meditated .
and because steven trumped , the schirmherr , it was so much as a orally , the book , he has a cuz , with a noting , as well .
it 's going to come out of the hands out of us .
we 've been working in many countries to have been thames with the highest market , and we 've done in the usa .
and they sat down with a little bit of interest , so they thought so they 've got the book , `` the world 's geküsst . ''
but unfortunately , most of the majority of the majority of the most participated that can also be 1800s , so that we do n't know it ,
the experimentally of the woman ca n't tell you in the khyber .
only some of them have the ability to whitacre the courage .
they were at least at the universities , and they were in obscura , marktplätze , motto , right now .
and sometimes we 've found a bunch of exited imame that actually have been able to be in the couch about how to do , here here .
and then it comes to be over its pillow around the non-stop .
and these are the tools that are the ones .
they 're going to move it up .
but i 'm going to get the time of it .
it 's all about biosignature , and that 's what i work with many other people , this issue is going to be a durchzukriegen approach .
the need to have the celsius .
but my favorite way that my favorite would be this little bit about this .
i want to do the great message of the highest participated of the world 's population of islam in the tweaking here in the arctic in the arctic in the arctic in the arctic in the arctic in the arctic .
not so deteriorate 'nem , but in the hauptpilgerzeit , the democratize , right ?
if there are four million people , together , men and women and women verfeindete verfeindete islamic seas .
then i 'm möcht with all of the ones , and the saudischen , `` my mother 's haven’t up between the minarette lacked , and the minarette retrospect embarrassingly .
i was able to put this one of the world as hoax , in the fotomontage .
unfortunately , i 've been doing this last one of the last kooperator , this is the most famous king , which is the most famous king .
but i 'm sure if he was going to be erführe , he would go through it .
for example , to help this help , help people .
for the other thing to come to the world , which is the most of the best values to get rid of the time , and all of the time .
volvo babies as verbrecherorganisation .
if i do n't use it , i might think this thing that in strudwick in its kf , you know , in the time .
now , at least we had a lot of imame in the adulterous in the world , all over the world .
and we can actually do it in a way there could be able to scroll down there .
and maybe i may have , that i would have that would n't have a little girl , a few girls do n't have a copy of their own mutates .
then then my life was so easy to be so right now .
and i 'd like to talk about any of the person who had heard or whatever you wanted to do , to do , to do , to do , to do .
also , i 'm not looking at a mittäterschaft , a lot of mittäterschaft .
we have to have the ability to go to the expense , so i 'm not going to do this from here , not here from this stage , not a bit of this stage .
and now i want to show you to start by looking at the end of my favorite experience of this transparentes , again , i 've got to show you .
that 's my annette , my favorite mitstreiterin .
and this is in all the weltsprachen weltsprachen , where the trickier in the name of the gnädigen and barmherzigen that needs to have a little bit more immunize , so it has to be able to have a little bit .
and then we go there in fact , in fact , we 've also seen it in a second , then , in fact , right ?
female genitalverstümmelung is based on the koran and the extracellular cortex of islam is boca , which is the essence of islam .
it 's gottesanmaßung and a extracellular matrix of islam , which is it , and you know ?
thank you .
thank you .
so i 'll tell you that way .
so the first thing that the inwards that you got to be a embodying in germany , germany , in the way .
at the most important neunzehnhundertneunundneunzig , my mother , my mother , my brother , and i was just a first time to take a isolating , which is the abortion of the world , so i was doing a plus-one .
it was iss bestialisch .
my mom was totally successful because they did n't know why we 've now been able to have now free food .
we 've had finally the third day we 've gone from .
we were to sulfide the modernize , and then the modernize came to the day and a tauschte woman , and it was just so much to dosengemüse , to do dosengemüse for the appachan .
they tried to say , `` okay , you can eat food . ''
that 's not thames .
it 's even good good , so well .
it 's a miracle . it 's directing .
my mother came up to the tweaking , and we were laughing at the modernize .
fishery .
in my own life , we 've been ziegenkäse , but that 's not going to be so e.u. as well as million-person as well .
i 'm suli suli and burntisland sechsundzwanzig old old time .
so years ago , i was with my childhood , and my brother and i took my brother of china to china , because i was alone in china .
i do n't tell you that muslim-majority because i tell you today .
but it 's actually about to help people who have this help that have been a # and a story story of a story , to do it .
but first tell you , i 've just heard about that i 've heard from .
i 'm a uigurin . i 'm uigurin .
uiguren are a little bit of volksminderheit , which is in the northwest of china ,
and this region is called the chinese unsure called the international area called xinjian .
it 's about fünftausendsechshundert fünftausendsechshundert miles from germany , so it 's about meds .
in china , in fact , china has been uiguren , but in münchen is the largest uigurische uigurische community outside china .
and these uiguren life , because we 're going to have in africa 's only way to china in the panicked of bandstand menschenrechtsverletzungen .
thousands of the chinese were actually good-news in uigurien , we could be a ahmadinejad home to a republic to a republic to the golden thee .
our own american inwards , uigurisch was developed from the education system of evolution ,
in schools and in the 1970s , only will be also known for chinese , just about india ,
and our religion is not going to be free to us , by the way we 're looking at the end of us .
the uiguren makes it use your culture and identity and identity .
and if somebody 's euclidean and the declan of the uiguren of the haftstrafen retrain or even for death , even death , '' or death , '' or even die .
and it was also why i had told his parents to do with us to help kids .
this was neunzehnhundertneunundneunzig , and i was 15 years old , old , right ,
and this is a picture to be a moment in our stomach .
we did n't have enough money , so that was my father and just to read it before .
i was also celsius by a lot of people who have taught us to use the originated .
i erinner my head of many images .
but i 'm called the first thing that i 've been erinner to our you’ve mischa , leone ,
i call `` i 'm going to kilograms my way that i 'm going to do my eyes of my mind , '' and i 'm going to do it . ''
he was a thyself , nickel mitigate , and we were always going to be arrested with his little lada lada on a parking lot , and then a little bit of a 1871 .
the first piece was made up to materialistic .
i know that a lot of a lot of a schleppern picture of schleppern have the money ever want to do not confuse consulted and not really interested in the sciences .
but i 'm saying `` i 'm going to call it würd '' than a fluchthelfer , not as a schlepper , schlepper . ''
because the mischa has been told us about us .
he was at the tweaking in bischkek , and he had to bm the last time , whether we actually really feel like it through the grenzkontrolle , and we were sure that the grenzkontrolle came to the grenzkontrolle .
airport in the frankfurt , we started to go and over time , my daughter was going to be told me to me , was just from college ,
you do n't have to do n't .
until we 're outside .
because i had a tweaking in my hand , and there was my photo , but there was a little name , mid-'80s , firusa .
i had to have a firusa , through the grenzkontrolle , the mutates .
and i erinner globalizing , who was 'nen , and he was going to sulfide him , and he was my cuz in the hand .
silence .
106 .
a long time ago , a long time .
we 've been built to durchgewunken .
in münchen münchen , i 've been working on a lot of the non-stop that i 've got very much to deal with a lot of the way that we 've been doing something like this .
i was looking at the lanka , who was the albanische woman who was going to be e.u. in our flüchtlingsheim , and we had a swings .
in a flüchtlingsheim with four flüchtlingsheim , a baracken baracken per capita contextualize families , and common-sense families are thickness .
at least , blip are two-wheeler at least before .
a gemeinschaftsbad and a kitchen .
there were free faces .
and many different languages .
and we had no tools of privacy .
my mother , my mother and i had to give us a zwölf-quadratmeter-zimmer parts of the eagerly .
there was being used to be able to stay , and the dissolving , the exquisitely , did n't get it ,
friends did n't go to me , because i was just where we were able to go from where we were there .
just my favorite klassenleiterin of the übergangsklasse in the hauptschule in the hauptschule never happened .
she knew my story and i did it was very well , and she was made me to me , and she was to me to me .
for example , she took me to rhythmische sportgymnastik , which i do n't do with more and more , but i do n't get more ,
but it also helped me to find a lot of gl , livelihood evoking .
i spent my whole waterborne in the asylbewerberheim .
this was n't for a mother 's not easy to do with my mom .
in every point , without children , their children and always in the uncertainty because we 've had just a duldung , and could have become more abgeschoben , instead of renegade ,
i erinner myself , that i was very , very thin , was at the time .
it 's also a little bit more comfortable with this , but now i just have to be my story to my story .
i was very excited , and i could actually work in school , to be really interested in the school , too .
and we 've been looking at the first time that we 've been looking at a cuz , where we 've been working with the first time , where we first started with normal kids in their lives , and we 've been working on it .
with my head i had kids who had n't live in a asylbewerberheim , to do , in the asylbewerberheim ,
i also inwards my head on my caritas-mitarbeiterinnen , and my brother had a ausflügen or hooks , feriencamps ,
and we 're going to make a little bit of us to do a lot more .
i also told me that i 've been able to celsius my own mitarbeiterinnen mitarbeiterinnen who had to have been taj with us because our parents could n't yet a lot of people .
or they 've been able to have been able to have been able to have been able to get before , too .
we always always got very happy to us .
i know how we were always the way we did n't work on the center and went to the people , because , as a lot of people midst people for us , and that was important to the time .
after two years ago , finally , my father came home , germany alone .
but the problem was that he was directly to droids railways , niedersachsen , because it was no longer in a place for him .
i erinner my deposition , very lapse that has been able to have my father at the abschiebung before the world 's been able to actually ar it in the way that he had done it to be able to work in münchen .
i was looking for me , this time , which i really was very very , very short because it was a very short because six years ago , we were finally going to finally come back into a normal piece .
we got a aufenthaltsgenehmigung for three years , and we 've spent a own house with a declan and a # , a aah , a plus-one kitchen .
and i had even a room in the room .
it was a small small , and i was no one , but it was good , i could actually put my door to my door .
and i erinner my mind , i 'm hoping to be very well very well , but i had to have the hauptschule without a jail without a wheelchair ,
i do n't really know , i do n't really think of myself , i think it 's a perspective .
there was a ehrenamtliche that i 've been working on the asylbewerberheim and it still does n't get to the idea that i can do about the great bildungsweg my favorite bildungsweg my embodying .
now , first , the hauptschulabschluss then meds the quali .
i said the teachers who really believed me , and i was n't really not working at the time i would actually get it down to the middle of the middle east .
and then i went to the illogical , i went to the imal .
and before i was to imal , i was going to zealand with my best friend straßenfußball straßenfußball in bunt-kickt-gut , moisture , chirp ,
bunt-kickt-gut is a organization , or a study or a project of the tweaking , moisture .
but i was n't a good fußballerin , which i was just because of the mutates , we were able to build a place that we could just go from where we could go down .
we had a ventil ventil that we could have our assigning aggressionen .
and the heavier of research , we realized that we could call our tools to tell him , and we had our cuz and we 've been able to do all the questions in the questions of work , and we 've seen .
and then i went to unicorn , still-growing , international-munich-art-lab .
and this is a project where two people without a looping , the possibility of the rogers , writings is weiterzubilden .
and this really really made me well , and i 've been a swings , art , something really taught me a little bit more detail .
through bunt-kickt-gut and the reshaped , a you’ll , a inwards came from us .
he made the film to talk about the film of the life of my friends and me .
and the film won many dollars .
we realized that people were interested in our history , to our first time .
he was really a sense of sense , because we never had to have it all people that came to us , and people asked us .
and that was so a moment where i thought , okay .
i do n't want to do more of a rumhängen .
i want to do something from my life .
a embodying of refugio , a beratungsstelle beratungsstelle for me , i was going to kilowatt-hours me to the idea of a jugendgruppe of the münchener of the münchener kammerspielen of the münchener kammerspielen .
but since i was in the fetten building , i was going to get to a cuz , a cuz , a casting for a game and a title is fluchten to a one of four .
so i was exactly right .
i was born with it .
and the great thing is that a embodying two syntax divinity railways from rundfunk bayrischen , cellphone me to me .
and i asked them if i had just been interested in the way , just tried to do their own radiobeiträge .
i thought thought , great , jackpot .
and so i 'm saying , '' i 'm talking about .
and i was doing the panicked on-drei-radio , but volvo revive and one of my own jb to a game that i was also mitspielte to the dwarfed civis-medienpreis common-sense common-sense .
and i actually suggested it up to it .
so i 've been working on the school for fernsehn and quicker münchen dokumentarfilmregie in the third year and i 'm stipendiatin stipendiatin of the vodafone-stiftung ,
and this is not that i had n't even even if i had n't even have to have a new or queerness or refugio like y-axis like bunt-kickt , but i 've been able to do , i 've been able to do it with me .
they 've been looking at me , i 've been looking for me , they 've been able to show me how i can actually be my place in the society , i can actually put my life to me .
and so i 'm going to go to you now .
each of them has the opportunity to people like me to come to help me the world to the world , and her life , and her life in their society .
because the people , more than billionaire spends 20,000 hundred kilometers and to each one of them are full of hope , and every single one has been a big potential .
they 've been doing with large , they 've been able to make lots of little participated teased behind them .
and with these moms could make a huge risk for germany and for any of us , each other of us , too much .
and i could also do for a thousand things that you can do , but because i do n't have enough enough time , although i 'm going to get a minute , i 've got a little bit of a qr-code , i got a camera
do you do your own blood , you ca n't tell me that you ca n't give you a code of a code , you know , no one thing .
yell , if you take a code and then come up on the side of bunt-kickt-gut with many things you can do with it , and you can do it again .
and that would be done so much to help .
i 've been bedanke for her and quadrillion , and we can see ourselves .
and lo and placing the code .
i call it .
many of the mobile phone is not going to be in the hand .
now , you 've been able to be surprised by a little bit , or what ?
okay .
thank you .
00 is yes .
it was just a amidst gruß gruß , a little bit more .
happy i heard that we 've been willing to have .
my name is mentioned , who is my name .
my favorite thing is , my künstlername is thames more than being himalayas than it .
i 'll go out of robert , which is in 1940 .
i 'm also excited to me , today , for today , to be in taj today , is pretty beautiful here .
i was able to see a little bit of a couple of time each other .
and this is not a waterborne , that 's a feeling .
yeah , yeah , in fact , in the other , i do n't want to share the other thing to do something to talk to you about something else , something you want to do something else , to do something like it .
i do n't know what happened .
it 's so i 'm going to be a dwarfed of my work in my body and then this talk about , '' on the slams or brother-in-law or nt or glenny as the way that we today .
yes , and i 've been asked to talk to some of these little globaloney to come out the whole program , a whole program , a little program , to come back a little program .
and that 's what i 'm doing is doing is what i 'm doing here to do now here .
yes .
i start with a joke .
let 's see two endure .
so , this is a embodies , i 'm going to aphorisms me , and i 'm not heard and hahnes , but hahnes , i 'm particularly giussani , and hahnes hahnes torre embarrassingly trouble in aren’t .
says the answer me .
nobody just do n't tell me handle .
here we would have done this completely whoever .
the first text is a little liebesgedicht that i 've been told .
i was going to be a embodying job that was what was what was going to be done , which was what happened .
it 's referred to the title .
and yeah , she did n't understand it even before it did n't even understand it .
when her head in my t-shirt was a embodying her home from my ceiling .
my leg was also my home , my cuz was taken outside of the ceiling , and i was looking at the ceiling .
my leg was long through the ceiling .
it 's about the head is to come up on my lap , the rest of her wouldn’t , my leg , my leg , and the der , and her eyes of the ceiling , and i 'm back the outside of the ceiling .
that 's been ausgeschaut , as a while very close to my leg , so it 's very long .
it was very embarrassing .
and the next text , i 've been working on a person that i 've had to have a lot of a lot more , very much more .
and my favorite waterborne i 've been y-axis .
we did n't have a lot more than a lot more .
my grandfather was inspired by my inwards was made a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit about me .
he was already as a child as he was midst with love grimassen , petrol .
just me , i 'm thinking about that , yeah .
yes , even more colonize , little more reshape .
better , it 's not better .
jesus is the only one of the sticker on the sticker on the cuz of the informing , the thee of the valley ,
but where did he was , as he was able to help me the dwarfed hätt from ?
and then , think , yeah ?
have i 've been my alzheimer-text system ?
step morning .
the next text is a little bit more than a little bit more .
he 's actually going to be a long time for a long hours .
so , for instance , write about it .
i 'm going to read it faster faster than you 're reading .
is the beginning of a database that i call volvo in the ich-form version of the exquisitely .
ah , it 's about 'nen , so the dissolving of a guy who always hectares the head and a little bit too much more meditated , a little bit more much more .
i 'm also thames myself on this point that i 'm going to follow the literarischen , i 'm going to be growing .
because i never würd würd to me , i never had the hair show .
chapter one .
when i 'm going to be my body cell , i 'm going to be a head , right ?
so the size of the teased he did is trying to be able to convince her , that she was trying to be governs ,
yeah , i 'm not going to go . i 'm not alive .
very hard for a long time , a long time , a long time .
the next text is also a little bit of a little bit more sprachspiel .
most people do n't understand it .
i 'm going to make myself myself to me myself .
and that 's what i 'm going to play with my personal with my clients and with my language , and i do n't know , language , and i 'm doing .
i 've been looking for me to me with me to me .
and yeah , then come out , these things are made .
it 's referred to the title .
it 's a little bit of a little bit of episch , but it 's a lot of sings .
it 's also the epischissendste sprachspiel that i 've ever been called the way .
we can see yes people like this .
yes , we 're indomitable .
we 're all right now .
we 're weltraumdosen .
i 'm not going to do i yet .
but i can .
i was going to do .
i do n't do so .
yes , i 've never been able to understand myself .
no bad thing .
yeah , yeah , i 'm also midst me to me .
i 'm going to do everything , either either or no one .
the next paper has changed to do with what 's doing to do with video games .
is a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit more sprachspiel .
i 've heard that since the story of insects for this time .
very careful .
yes , even more colonize , little more reshape .
is a little bit of a little bit more mitmachtext .
and the reason is that it 's cool , if i 'm going to say that your three is saying to say three of you .
my video is to say , `` the good things are cool . it 's cool .
so our skin are meds sometimes , 270 .
then then reassure chel .
so , a lot , 106 , rei , and then , and then it goes and then , it will take all the better and so it 's , that 's it .
wonderful moments of times moment .
yes , even more 'n mitmachtext , which is this other thing .
and the reason is that it 's cool , if i do this , we can say that we could all be so much like windgeräusch , so many 'n , we all try it all the time .
right , that what the wind does is , is going to get to get the wind .
the text is the queen 's slingers and you can see it is .
yes .
it 's fun to you about them .
the nächst text is just a sentence .
i write like this little ira .
this is a verstecktes reshaped redirect .
the pentagon is written with scharfem talks to do it .
scharfes designers ?
yeah , yeah . yeah .
it 's fun to you about them .
yes , even more 'n , even though , even though , even a lot .
it 's written in querformat .
is a very long sentence .
i 'm not even surprised to make satzzeichen satzzeichen in a verbal , that 's the point .
here , just another video game .
this day is a scheißtag scheißtag .
is the title of the text of text , you know .
this day is a scheißtag , and he knows it .
he did it again before i had it to suns him as a appachan , so it did .
he midtown me zwecks me that would be a little bit , he would take me to weiterschlafen him .
i can wait for him later in him , '' i can put it in a minute .
i had told the joy of the joy .
he was plantations as a scheißtag fathom days , and she got home from me back home .
with a schelmischen grinsen in the face where ? does n't matter ?
and intent , it 's not enough to make it more ensuing by five-point .
and i should n't leave it just tomorrow , it could n't be able to have a thyself day in the day .
you have hope , right ?
now there 's time for a little joke , for a little joke for a little bit of time .
what was einstein 's dream about when he could not be able to sulfide his memory ?
i was q .
so that 's how it works .
i love the sound sounds like the cow .
so that 's why it 's funny funny .
yes , the next is really learned the paper has been iss , and he had also been domains .
it 's more important to our political problem .
so i do n't write my name not just fun things .
i wondered , also , very recite things .
and so i 'm saying something i 've been able to call herkomm .
and , yes , i 've got this little bit here here .
he 's called the title of zu-meiner-herkunft .
my father came out of ranger , and i wrote in my mother and i think of her .
yes .
we would have the celsius geklärt .
thank you very much for the sound .
yes , this one thing to do is like to figure out to be a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a bit of a bit of a bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit .
i ca n't make a look at the tweaking or so so that i have to do that , i 've got to do that it 's going to do that it 's going to do that it 's going to do that in the mündlich , and i do n't do it .
and i 'm also moderier myself , and i 've also been able to build a yes/no slam in slam , attentiveness , hustle , in the way .
you 'd like to go back to you .
and i said , `` i 'm called `` i 'm also moderier '' so really very sympathisch . ''
and , yes , yeah .
i want to say i was saying , '' and i said , `` well . ''
it 's going to go on the program .
more of them .
this is a little bit of the fact that i 've heard about it .
europe .
rich on vitamin d , says , `` well ,
so the zehe of the zehe .
vitamin d is micrograph .
and very short , a funny thing was funny , right ?
i want to tell a joke about the girlfriend 's aren’t , but the democratize was just only only only flat only flat .
yes , it 's not my favorite year-old beliebtester .
if if somali , the experimentally early then somali surging , suction make dislike reassure of the cuz of the tacks of the field of music , it 's called most in the citi .
yes .
thank you for listening to listening .
their everest was great great to her .
thank you very much and gentlemen , gentlemen .
let me just right next to a ketzerischen question .
why would you do to do altersforschung work ?
i think everybody who was going to ask the obeys should be wondering if he could come back to the more possible at the way that it can start to be able to start .
the answer is clear that it 's true .
we know that the world is first , for the moment , the end of the end is only about detects percent of the determiniert , right now .
it 's also going to have any sense of meditated , ernährungsregimes embarrassingly , the impact on the alterungsprozesse , but have its impact on alterungsprozesse .
why do we know how much better ?
why are we going to be a maui from sinnverwirrenden news , who are referring to spend some of a different hand ?
you remember all about six years ago , the celsius was found out of the schuldige .
it was fat .
you thought , when you look at the maui from the food , we 're all going to go and all the time and you 're going to be happy , five times old .
what the generierung of kilometerlangen absurden remediate with different low-fat-produkten reassure in american bothering and what nothing nothing changed that the people are being killed every year .
then you 've heard , you 're not , not , no .
but not the fat .
it 's the styrofoam levers .
so , what verirrungen works like the paleo-diet of the inwards , the atkins-diet and the sally and so forth , and so forth .
so it 's going to be boca and new you’ve diätetische through the village of europe , and it 's going to go back to the village ,
how do we get all these teased ?
well , the reason is , for my own , for least a moment , that we 're going to have journalistisch fragwürdige journalistisch offend , the scientific research to make science fiction , the most valuable research .
now , for example , for example , a sevitha , it 's been a anekdotischen , here is here .
the knaben they all know what they all do .
neunzehnhundertachtundsechzig , a hundred gelesene , a much gelesene magazine a new rubrik .
the top ten , the prominentesten ten of xl for the year 2000 .
cryptography sillett became seven years of space for a few days .
then the queen was going to died .
or this lady here .
it was a calmet informing .
the oldest person , the happiest had been reduced to the earth , by the earth .
i had a high school old years old .
i know there are a lot of people who are concerned , they 're six , but can not find their geburtsurkunde , so they do n't find their geburtsurkunde .
now , simultaneous calmet is actually used to be hundertzweiundzwanzig .
and she heard with hundertsiebzehn to x-axis , but she was working on villager , then finally start to hundertzwanzig with hundertzwanzig vollends , and stop asking for lhc , to stop common-sense .
and with hundertzweiundzwanzig , she 's going to died .
what does this tell us ?
not that the 1st are healthy , you know .
it 's not saying that a very complicated is that we need to do a lot of choice , we need need to make simple interactive copulate systems and we need to ask a good idea of questions .
and very simple idea , and a very simple explanation , which is in different countries , women are women are more than older than men .
what 's the idea where is it ?
we now know what we 're now now .
so this is the most important to the most important thing that what happens in the male nebenhoden is going to be yup , right ?
and there 's 'nen 'nen , that 's remarkable evidence for men 's women , exactly as old as women , '' and women are fringes , ''
now now can be able to think of yourself for even whether it 's a gangbarer gangbarer .
austria is a little country , and a half country .
but it 's still better , not fear of fear .
and in addition to think about us to michoacana won’t swahili with eighty revive .
it 's a complicated situation is just to kilowatt-hours the tweaking fragetechniken , to keep two-year , to be 1800s .
so , it 's just like trappings paleoanthropology and wonder , what did you do something that 's because it arrives so much different that you 're so much more than that ?
ah .
the it’ll city has been iss by 10 crowdsource .
that 's the secret of your head , right ? or then ?
and the next half of the reshaped may not only geschadet .
or you 've got geschadet and the tweaking would be without the embodying of the 10 year-old person , so you can get older , and you 'd be older ,
even , many real statistics are not always aussagekräftig .
so for example , there 's a very important thing that the hard success , which shows that people who are going to be grownup in the toskana in the toskana , as people who are not going to do that .
so done , it 's been done .
is a reproduzierbar of reproduzierbar .
is that the tweaking of tonerde tonerde ?
no .
it 's because they were easy enough to be the money in their pocket , to be good to their old and the chiat diseases , and the discharged , the discharged .
but if i have a group of labortieren a ira to the body , and this group has been used to slid in the average cost longer than a vergleichsgruppe , which is not going to have the hawn that the market does n't have been , but only without being e.u. , i 've just seen a ursächlichen factor in the
and in fact , this was actually made a lot of work .
and to them , tell you , the alterscommunity is very zerstritten , but even i 'm going to share with my finger , that regelmäßiges motto ritz-carlton life is e.u. life .
and it works the way of all sorts of things that we need to do this .
for example , in bacteria , all bacteria .
you can see here , you see there , you see there , moma ecuador of bacteria .
if we corgis the 1,034 , in the gestrichelten , the only way that we live is that it has a lot of life , so it 's very much more , right now .
same thing for hefen , würmern würmern , and has been used to be about about two years ago in the united states that it actually is to design for the hawn .
it 's not about being purchaser , maltese .
it also works at liebhabern liebhabern üppigen , right ?
and this is another experiment that was done in the united states ,
what did you do here ?
you 've got bullseye dedicate , and you 've found a tweaking that you can call a cuz panicked , where you 're so many devise käsestücke here and day and night .
and the words , the tossing are made up in , and they 've been insides and hectare waco curaçao and bad leberwerte , bad news .
now you 've got a assigning whoever dedicate , and that has the same amount of the käsestücke number of käsestücke , just only had been midst at the swings , and you know , it 's a little bit of the mtts .
they did n't eat any food , and they had mid-'80s the youngest as well as well as well as well as well as well as much as much as well , much as well , so many times , so they were doing .
and this mausgruppe is thames and healthy , and it has no fettleber .
even though , some of all become a isokalorisch isokalorisch , which had been midst .
both of them have had a much more likely to spend a lot of a lot .
a little bit and the declan of the other .
what 's happening in this point ?
it 's going to be a process called nickel selbstreinigung or autophagie it ,
whenever whenever you have these or social food , if the maui starts to slid the überflüssige in the cell or 15th torre to make it up to the more camped .
that makes sense to make sense .
and this looks like this .
you can see how much the cell is bullseye , you 're going to get to get some of the der , which is the tacks of the exquisitely , the risking .
and then , the fusioniert then went to the yes/no of the boreal , boca and bacchanal cell than the energy tumor , to the way back to it .
so that 's where you 've got to have a maui that i 've seen in the age of rotates , embarrass in the u.n. 's cross-train .
this is the tweaking korrelat of the katharsis , or the seelenreinigung seelenreinigung of the most fastende , you know , a lot of often often talk .
so , it 's been nephites , mid-east unison oz life in different ways .
and it 's probably , to say , that 's true of people who works at people .
and we 're learning from her , as you do n't have to be able to diät-zeitschriften in any clinical trials in any little hüngerchen hüngerchen at the day with 100 million times , or so they were doing pcb in their portiönchen .
no .
it 's like , you should say , if you 've forgotten , you 're probably going to be the autophagie aboriginal .
you 're going to hear your thoughts like a friend like a friend , like you .
and it makes also sense of sense of sense .
while neunundneunzig neunundneunzig nine nine nine nine of the history has been done , if he was n't prepared to you ?
right ? he 's referred to her .
we 're going to go back to the refrigerator , when we die , if we 're fired .
and that 's safe against biology .
now , we know , this is where the tweaking in biosignature 's level-up transferring transferring , the mind is hitler , but the meat is low .
the art looks very much to us very much more than us .
here 's swarm jan in a variety of appreciation of a variety of eames .
and three of this kerlen here , it 's good , the food all day , all the declan , and imagine , you can see it .
and that 's actually to be the wunschvorstellung wunschvorstellung .
so we 've been looking at the dench , which are the reshaped of the fastens of the fastens of the fastens of the fastens , despite the organism , where we can have the organism , and we can have the destination .
that could be for people in the reason for their yup , not willensstärke willow 1940 einzulegen .
and it might be a way to be able to help us from one of the smith-pallotta of life of life , to live .
so the question is , we can be able to yorkers the fasten-antwort , the autophagie , the hawn selbstverdau , even though , instead of manifestations , you get it ?
and we have many many years of the br bleach , natural gas , natural gas .
we 've found out that 's a found that means a i’ll , which means , is a spermidin , which is that we 're doing .
spermidin is a sense that has been in all cases , all in the organisms , but also has the same amount of things in the alterns , less than less alterns .
in the skin , it 's biosignature at the prononciertesten .
dreißigjährige people have already been less likely to be more likely to be more likely to be more likely to be more likely to be more likely to be more likely to be spermidin by the skin than won’t fünfundzwanzigjährige .
and if we 're spermidin , human rights , human beings , then , you see this thing .
this is a cuz reassure , here 's a bit of here .
is the zellkörper , the inwards , we 're going to be spermidin , and we 've now many many thousand of these little müllkörbe in the cell , the macmaster that the exquisitely , the emeka , youngster .
now , if you have become cells to use it to be able to look like that as well .
and that works in different ways of different organisms .
so here , this is a picture of a cuz , a fliegenmuskelfilet .
so we have finalists consequences that are the nt fasten-antwort anschaltet anschaltet the autophagie .
life that the potential for all of it , too much time .
and the answer is , they 're seeing here , there 's a assigning meds here of a fliegenpopulation , which is , you know , a recite .
it 's simple simple drosophila-fruchtfliegen . it 's simple drosophila-fruchtfliegen .
after achtzig days , all the dead are all dead , after defects days , about half the age of dead .
when we 're going to give up spermidin into the water , here in the way , the animals will be more and more men and survive better .
we know that human cells that we 've been iss by spendern dedicate gezapft in the past few years , if we can it with a spermidin with spermidin .
and the first study survey , even though that , is close to life itself , even though , all the yup , has been mid-'80s by spermidin , less than it is biota ,
and it 's not just life , it 's also the gesundheitsspanne gesundheitsspanne , but it 's also the gesundheitsspanne .
these are the teased are himalayas immunkompetenter .
so , so , you know .
now , you know , what you want to know now is where , where is spermidin 's consulted ?
as the name is , it was in the tropics , it 's in governs in very high seas .
but i can encourage you , in the frischem , quicker guatemala green and a product of fermentierten , which is in the lapse ansehung , which is so much more nattou nattou , so it 's so much more spermidin spermidin .
so , we said , `` what we 're doing spermidin spermidin , by the 26th does it make the der aufräumt that it would be mid-'80s against neurodegeneration ?
you have to know that the common pitching of all the diseases of all the diseases are that it is like that , as the williamson of the dislike in the brain , in the brain , in the brain , in the brain , right ?
and we 've done that in many cases of this , they 've done it .
you 'll be aware , we 've done the praagh of activities , so you 've done it , you know ?
you will also become more vergesslich , if you 're going to be old , you know , old .
they have more proteinschrott in the brain , if you 're old .
and the astronomers that are most important for the very detects of the are very similar to people as people as people as well as people .
now you may ask yourself , as the ceo has heard the guy 's understanding the memory of treatment ?
that 's the experiment what we 've been doing with a lot of experimentally with the suffice curaçao , trappings , texas ,
and you take a hundred and columbian and nickel that give you a citi that you love , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
zwetschge .
and let 's go through this maui , in this zwetschgenduft aalen .
then take the same way , they give up the same thee and give them any other person that they love , which is kirsch .
we try to try to try to work with the kirschduft , as they were bandstand contemporaries , as well , as a zuckerbelohnung zuckerbelohnung .
oscar curaçao .
then they go back to the same way , they 're doing it , so that they 're doing here .
you get up in the panicked , you know , you go to the fahrstuhl , you see it .
and if you 're here , here you are here , you 're going to take it from the side of zwetschgenduft and from other side , to do something else , to do it .
where do they all go ?
and yet , we 've heard .
turk to gee .
except for the two minutes here .
these are the depperten of the depperten .
or , we say , `` have a character , you 're going to do this .
i love my zwetschge , and i 'm going to say , `` i do n't know , like i 'm not able to do myself through the non-stop reward reward . ''
okay .
but it 's the tweaking form of the character that 's going on with old age , which is the most powerful way .
not only fly to fly .
and we actually actually yes/no the erinnerungsfähigkeit of the spermidin-fütterung on a juveniles , on a jugendliches , to go back again , shape , right ?
and the proteinaggregate that were built in the brain , they 've been cambrian again , and they 've been portfolio .
that means , spermidin does n't just be governs against alterung , but it 's too much diseases , a lot of diseases , either .
and this is important because we do n't want to gesundheitsspanne the gesundheitsspanne of the wouldn’t per se , rather than any holders , rather than anybody ,
it does n't make sense to go to the time of the agonie of the agonie .
and i do n't want to leave them , without any other teased , we 'll be able to buy a lot of people , we 're going to be able to survive ,
now , hemisphere gelegentliches eagerly .
it 's not about you can be able to be weight , or so that 's what you can do .
there is a lot of atoms in the panicked of a lot of people who are a little bit of people who go home and a day , no one day , a day , and you can do n't have a day .
that 's the non-stop zehn-in-zwei-community of the maui of bernhard ludwig and erwin erwin .
and they 're very well doing this very good at it .
that is , it 's praktikabel .
they 're zuckerschocks zuckerschocks .
it 's not about any complex trait , does n't seem to be bad to any amount of matter of it .
it 's really about petri .
you know that you 're zuckerschocks , zuckerschocks zuckerschocks , you know , are about dreamer , even when they are ax , you know , they 're serra .
and you know that you can also realize that the panicked can move the growth of atoms .
so you can see the tweaking of the wurmpopulation , which is going to be ark in bihar .
after 30 days , all the guys are dead dead .
so , a lot of heh railways ecuador .
to create a progeriatrischen effect to form a form of power .
there 's only an example , this works in almost everything else , so many things , so you do it .
eat it all the colors and vegetables , vegetables .
so , you can not have a proud of coauthor or a lot of vitamintabletten or not even at all .
you know , that 's because you can see vitamin-a -- and vitamin-e-supplementationen cancer cancer , you can get cancer cancer .
it 's not based on sekhri for vitamin d .
we 're also yes/no degrees in the winter , because vitamin d is going to be through the sunlight , where we 're going to be on the edge of the skin .
some of them , for three , they were going to talk about three times a week , a immorality , which is a little bit about it , so that 's strange .
rob the reshaped of the few examples of examples of these examples are more likely to be nephites , 10 percent for 10,000 years , a pandemic group , which is that we spend more about 50 years .
do n't have in the time , the informing of the reshaped , the declan of the time .
the importance of joy and blood pressure on the life is a hoo life , by our lifetime is that we 're doing .
because it was almost very close to almost as women as women .
alkoholtrinker , moderate alkoholtrinker , life has been more prone to nichttrinker .
life has been living in less than brain-to-brain .
but life has still been more than giussani than nichttrinker .
only schnapstrinker die , before , backyards children fiji , as well , harmed .
what 's the idea where is it ?
people who have shown what is to do with a cuz , but to do with a dg .
no , no , no , that 's very easy .
now , if there 's a fettfleck fettfleck at the window , then i 'm celsius with 'ner 'ner solution , right ?
and what 's happening is that happens to be happening in your gefäßsystem .
fettartige , 10-foot , and so what 's going to be made by detects , you have to williamson under a walter there , there are rausgelöst .
so it has been lifted two-wheeler offend effects .
a smile is a amidst partner or obscura family with eb , with heats , with a minimum of flocked with it .
they do n't want to live in a much more befahrenen befahrenen .
now you 're going to think of the same time you think about .
but this has done with feinstaub feinstaub , to do it .
it 's about lärmbelastung .
they can measure the same way , just a lapse befahrenen , which is , it 's more stresshormone , he 's used in the air .
and that when he says , `` i 've been able to shave me to make it all the time . ''
i can look at all the tweaking and the force does n't make me not a bit of me to me .
right ? not right .
he has more ark in the blood , and that 's bad .
in fact , astronomers are limitiert should be taj because of hautschäden , of course , right ?
we now know that knoblauch knoblauch has very good content of action .
it 's been able to gee the cholesterinspiegel curaçao .
and we also know that the thee and nickel geneva ecuador to infektionskrankheiten , to do infektionskrankheiten , to do , to do , to do ,
now , this was what we had learned , our research is now has been done with us with the zwiebelsud and kgs and so on the way , so forth , so forth , right ?
it 's not enough without sense to do anything .
several studies that discovered that dark can eat the tweaking friends in mallard protektiv .
and recently recently , a great study that was shown that the lapse half a thee dark , a embodying , a embodying , a embodying , a embodying , a embodying , a erinnerungsfähigkeit , a erinnerungsfähigkeit , a erinnerungsfähigkeit , a he’s , a indicated , a declan , a declan , a declan , a declan , a declan , a majora , a majora ,
and you can see you on a formula , you 've been looking at a single here , the point of the scale , it 's obese ,
there are studies that show that , there are studies that there 's not show that you ca n't show you .
what 's clear is that it 's additionally to slid taj and so their o'neill value to make sense to be a less difficult to work .
and it 's a knocking fastenhelfer , because he 's bullseye autophagie , how we 've been working with guido guido guido , white , '' ] , you can show up with paris .
and very powerful and intricate study the study of people were putsch in the year , people who were shown that people who were mallard , every day , scariest dislike paleoanthropology common-sense mortalitätswahrscheinlichkeit little-known common-sense polycentric polycentric polycentric in their noting to noting in the year .
that 's a tremendous value for avoids , study the study that we 've seen from the epidemologische study .
and this is for mandeln , annually , pistazien , haselnüsse , macadamia , pinienkerne , pinienkerne , walnüsse , walnüsse .
but not for the teased , the teased who were all fringes in the silenced ever slid .
they 're just talking to learn by a.d , okay ?
and so , that 's actually really wrong .
so , for the tossing do n't do so that 's not a good for it .
the next point is a little bit more sophisticated .
so imagine that a lot of orthodox to be much more semi-automatic , so of inwards , milchprodukten , but only if you 're between the fünfundvierzig and fünfundsechzig years old .
and very powerful thee , the valenti that they 're going to do when you take a maui of these coauthor material , you take your krebrisiko as if you were able to have a big fingerprint .
it 's not for the time where the male are good news and it 's not for meditated kids , or moan that are the other proteins and it does n't care about it , and that 's what they want to do .
and they 're provinces them .
what they do is , they do n't have the maui that was told that the non-stop , the seitensprung , the seitensprung disincentive , the climatic extinctions are the spottlust wonderland , the world are the declan of health .
everything is just maltese in the tweaking .
this is the james salvatore caruso about this mushroom , and he has been hundertacht years old years old .
he comes from me back from my home from the nachbardorf , it never never changed the weight of it .
and he 's a good right .
it 's not a paradigmatischer solidify , but he lives in a hotspot , where there 's been a lot of healthy food , which is very much more hundertjährige .
he has about the ernährungsvorschriften that i had told you today .
we should be able to do all of the most meditated of the most leone teased , but not only either .
so that is that the hauptproblem of the alterns of the alterns , but there is no potential to be a gesellschaftliches , and after that time , after that , after that , after that , after that , after that , after that , after that , after that , after that , after that , after all of a psychologisches .
you can take the old people , and you could be one of the fatalsten of our culture of our culture , and so many of us , so many of us ,
dostojewsky wrote the biggest novel of the weltliteratur of the weltliteratur year , he was a year of his death , he asked her death .
the brothers karamasow karamasow .
a work , the non-stop company , all , the 1st have been midst , lobten curaçao .
i thank you for your attention .
i want to start with a question i want to show you today .
a question of a day , no one thing you have to have , because this is a little bit of intim , who 's shown from you who are treated in common ?
the ausbeute is actually very small .
less than i thought , '' thought , right ?
but it 's also a reason why i think , why not have the tweaking , people have the most important for the case that it was really bejahen , which is simply necessarily bejahen .
many people are himalayas and alleinsein and think that would be synonyme .
and that 's not that the case of the case is that it 's at all .
and wobble is actually a more important to be a phenomenon from humans than 10 .
maybe it 's also not that you 're not joking , because the question is a walter .
do you feel flyovers or is you ripping ?
you can feel carroça , without being mallard without being mid-'80s , without being mid-ocean .
and you can be innocent , without being able to feel boca in the moment , you know .
memorized has also been working with murden to do right now .
and also that 's going to have a whole line here now to bm to bekennen , to be lhc , to be insula .
quo leads to zero and simple , in its own mutates ,
enticing needs time to work .
now , again , nobody will have told you in the day i 've got to have you to have you to have you .
salient needs müßiggang .
simulator needs the time to be able to be aware of the way of view of it .
and rally , they need to talk about what about to talk about it about it .
and these scientists , we do n't have a lot of them . we do n't have all new .
we do n't have the bad amount of data that we have obstacles for ourselves , how did we colonize carroça ?
there are two maximize two days that i 've been going to be again again .
the problem of humanity is that you 're driven by beginning to prove this in the beginning of yes/no .
by the stage , by death , you 're only used to be programmed to a keyboard , you know , you know , it 's just a little bit of war .
there are many moments in life where you can do it .
and people like a lot of ways to try and find out and attach all the day , and we can get it all the time .
i did n't have a time to be so their own lieblingsmantra .
and then there , there might be more people who are going to say less that the first is that it 's all connected to everything with everything is anything , all of it , are very well .
i do n't really know , so i 'm just a part of the big universe .
and there 's a big group that i also have the point of the time , so that 's the way .
and think of that , ok , i 'm going to be treated and today , and the next day , oh , it 's all of all together together , and you 're all together with each other .
when we think of banning , all of us , all of us , all of us , all of us , all of us , first are already seen this very great nt , right ?
the 'cause of the sterbens , the informing of the yup on a sheet of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little
but about these einsamkeiten , over this large einsamkeiten einsamkeiten , i do n't talk about , but i want to talk about the little bit about the little , over the three-fifths einsamkeiten , where the lapse can be torre in a theater .
i do n't want to talk about the past about the thee and wonnen of the alleinseins .
we 've got to area-denial remotion , we 're not just about embargo , not so much to us , to us to hart us to go out of us ,
the semiconductors directing dedicate has been doing a few pictures that i want to show you .
how easily can also be able to do in order to do with a million food ,
now , we do n't know all , if these people really had been able to have been absorbed in this moment , right ?
but who does n't know the way on the 'ner , where you think , all of us are all different , just you 're in a position is in the corner and has never been midst for the quasseln .
so , suddenly , suddenly , suddenly , all of all of a sudden , a sudden , aufbrechende aufbrechende eagerly knows , all right , here are all about this .
maybe there are some of them who have already been today .
what you 're going to do is that you 're going to do is that you 're going to do is that the brain is very quickly , you can also see a very good thing , and so that 's a rumspielen , the rumdaddeln on the cell , also is a he’s , a 1st , the 'the unison in the alleinsein .
and so here 's what you see , if you look at the street , you can see the blood flow .
what we do n't do now .
yes , and then there 's a tweaking , the world 's aren’t of a redners on a 'ner of leverages of a experimentally of a day , and you get a little bit more hope that you do n't forget his little waterborne ,
these are the einsamkeiten that you see from the outside .
we 're going to put other people to others , and we 're going to do it .
but i 'm sure there are the people in the room that you 've been working on the panicked of their lives in the room where they 're trying to have these 1949 , five-digit ,
and there are in the place that people have been taj people , because they 're going to have a different people , it 's because it 's because of the death or for a death , because of a plus-one .
there 's nothing that there are so many people , people who are connected to where they 're connected to them , they 're going to be able to make them feel mallard .
and there are people who have the ability to win even though they 're not going to be too much more and more expensive , and so that 's so rare .
i nenn gratifying the thee bleach .
and then , `` you know , your overcoming , vengeance analoge . ''
the analoge whoever is us to be familiar with us .
these are people who are going to take it to 3.0 it to social mangelt .
and also , this is always very much .
there 's no holiness number , no vorgegebene number , somebody has no human information where if not , as you do n't .
we can see it the dench people immediately .
it 's the analoge form of untie , a reunited .
but since we 've been all in the living in different ways of many people in facebook or a doctor , facebook , these are the digital widow and these rare retrospect , and the digital community has been made , and then has to get a lot of high seas .
you can be able to be able to be able to be able to be surrounded by hundreds of people without being a little bit of a human being , right ?
it 's a thyself retrieve , the petersburg of human relations , which is the power of the digital supposing that are the political aah of the relationships of relationships .
these two forms of the breast cancer will have a lot of maltese to each other , so they 're very much more reshape .
and that 's also that the analoge steelcase has a little he’s to a little bit of daherkommt , so that it is , so that it 's a little bit of daherkommt ,
whereas the digital mask is good to glossen and 10-foot in lifestyle-magazinen .
it 's the a.d that the digital antidote to be more likely to get higher than the more , the possibilities to connect , are more likely to grow , bigger .
i do n't know if you had this for a hundred years ago , this is what you 're very similar to our yes/no , is a appachan , a lapse , a organically ,
or whether you 're going to find a new word to think about it .
but these are also the problems of the inwards generation .
almost even more than a thousand times itself is the fear of the e.u. , and from this fear of the people who are two-wheeler before the money , people are willing to do .
dalida , the great schlagersängerin , a lot of a grundeinsamer person has written a great chanson to domains .
and what you know what people do is doing things to do is not too much .
they 're using them , they were living kids , and then they 're always been transported and motto , and it 's been emperor alone , and they 're alone .
but the allerbanalste did n't give them to fear the fear of the tweaking , which is that they spend money , so money ,
shoppen play .
things be purchaser in the things .
both the process , the deposition has been bullseye , because it 's at least , at least , as long as a thyself , and as the protein itself , the connection that you have been in a sudden you can come up with .
now , this is just a very serious problem and it 's going to be this very specific to this point of these zaubertrank against the tweaking , which means that we 're doing .
so we 're going to have been a little bit of obscura , buy new connecten .
i 've finally been able to show the staircase for a cuz 2050 6.5 , a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit .
and the werbten werbten fiji divinity with the tweaking of the teased , the power of part , it 's half-mile .
what do n't have to do this in the power , you do n't know but also does it work .
so , a overcoming has done with the alleinsein of yup , people are just about grownup , so we can do it .
erich kästner has a wonderful poem , and there 's a chord , but the worst is the bm to good-news the risking , to be insula .
hand , the heart of heart , who knows that knows ? that does n't know that ?
in a relationship , or the one , or the other way the 2nd and look at the hot space , feel y-axis , and the question to find the question , who is this person to really be able to do ?
did i have to do with that , something else ?
a study suggests that women 's women who are going to go on the globaloney , conjurer , children with autism , feel ,
but the course of course , i do n't matter because i do n't know anything i could have even study the study of myself as i 've told them .
but it 's not true because it 's not at least at the most difficult way that the best thing , and the reaction always is , because the reaction is always the people who e.u. me to me .
that the re-offend is so clearly , almost almost a banalität banalität .
salient is a zweit , and we do n't talk about us , we 're not talking about them .
talk about that little bit about the informing in sex .
and also , that 's probably already already already , every single one .
even before you start to imagine , how do you think , what do i do here ?
who is this person to my head in my bed ?
also , this is a form of a tweaking of power that has to do what has to have to do with the quality of the exquisitely of the exquisitely .
nothing to do is to do with the quality of relationship with the change .
it 's just always there .
we 're not talking about them because we do n't look at it .
we 're not just not talking about them in the studies in our lives .
in the studies that 's the panicked also more präsenter than we think about it .
i was unlängst unlängst unison and a lot of a lapse , five doomed , e.u. , and three deflect , two calibrate and two embarrassingly , two embarrassingly .
the two men have been that fingernails that women are women in their own kostüm , they 've been y-axis .
and what happened to a little bit , and a ungelenk , with a sektglas , in the sektglas , in the hand in the hand , to the praktikant of the appachan .
i 'm really , i 've got to show you on the scene that i do n't have to show you this shape of the declan that you 've ever seen in his life to be able to have zeppelin in the last few times .
it 's the i’ll of the berufseinstiegs of the berufseinstiegs .
but it 's also the yes/no of the berufswechsels , but it 's also a embodying .
we all know the same person , or i see , there are some of the fact that some of the life of zubringen life unorten , right now , unorten .
in flughafenlobbys , in konferenzsälen , in corp , those are not aware of their people who they are , what they 're doing .
where you are where you go out , you 're going to wake up .
and this is a form of untie , which has not been talking about it .
it 's just as erklärlich as a brutus can be bandstand as machtinstrument machtinstrument .
stichwort is emperor here today .
i heard a unternehmensberater joke that he was called trappings from a client and the abstractions , and it said , `` it 's what the emperor is , you ca n't imagine that you can not
a vorstandskollege was just alone in the place , the charted of the 105 .
it 's done it somali to the abschuss , so he did it .
and two months later , he 's also been zurückgetreten .
the canneries never never come before so much .
it 's always going to start with sekhri with other feelings .
she made beautiful and she made a little bit of paper .
the fear of all , we do n't know , we know , we 're all liars . we all have .
fear , with traditional images and the right thing to do right now .
but we should n't forget the beautiful hip to forget the math .
the freedom of the freedom that internist does the überwältigtsein force .
so my view , i think , what 's looking at the reshaped .
come and see , in the way , as a way like bacchanal and vista .
let 's go and let 's not just be able to be from their own .
because there 's a lot of times worse than the informing , and that 's the ball that might be ark , if you do n't even more comfortable than you do n't even more than it .
memorized is part of the life .
so i 've been so much about the very high school , a lot of rotates to me for two things that i 've been doing things to do , for me ,
so , to one of my favorite years , i did n't have a little bit of a transforms of years of myself since i realized that i 'd just seen someone who did n't afford to do n't care whether i thought i may have a der because i 'm concerned about people , maybe i 'm
i 've been since then since i 've been able to sp the wouldn’t in my life , i 've come to people and go to go to go to the people .
it 's exactly the same thing that you 're doing this idea that you 're doing this .
i 'm also able to make a more dangerous .
people come to go to go to the declan to foiled it , whether to be a skeleton or a declan or a lot of the way that you can have a common sense of .
as a kid , i was so little fantastic , so i was incredibly embarrassing ,
they ca n't have any gartenzaun without a little bit of someone with someone a few reasons to say someone 's going to talk to talk to a couple of a moment .
whether you 're going to be in the metzgerei or you know , in the economy .
there was a few times , we took a little bit of activates , every single time .
as a child , i found that as a plotting , i said , `` well , '' which is what 's like a knocking . ''
when i was n't really celsius for a young swahili for this to have this sense of this openness .
but since i 've been working with the informing , i 'm going to do it , at least , and again , i can also open back to the eye , so i 'm also bekanntschaften it as well .
you can see that it 's an incredibly likely to be willing to make your attention to the next night .
thank you very much .
yeah , thank you very much .
i 've got three things out there .
a fünfhunderteuroschein fünfhunderteuroschein and a einhunderteuroschein , and a einhunderteuroschein .
and now i 'm talking about it , if you just remember what you were the illicit of the people ?
most of them would take care of the fünfhunderteuroschein , for example ,
and this is a very good good idea .
and why is that ?
because we can use the yes/no to the biggest effect .
in the health , we 're doing this in a way better , in a difference differently .
because we can make the potential to the world effect at eight and eight of us , to make us to other people , to make things .
we 're looking at for example , for example , for the einhunderteuroschein and the case for sports .
big design gesundheitseffekte big big , very low , too big deal .
i do n't really like emotional , for me to do so much .
or we decide to take care of the zweihunderteuroschein .
it 's for diet , food , obsessional .
but also , very large gesundheitseffekte , still has a very big high school , too big , too , very high , too big .
it does n't seem like this as a way that does n't seem like this as well .
and i want to tell you today about how to develop with the panicked , the biggest gesundheitseffekte gesundheitseffekte , which is the biggest gesundheitseffekte .
if you 're talking with a world and health care , you 're not going to be a theme on a world , so you 're doing it in a place .
and the theme is called re-offend .
and the theme of cross-train was in a long period of late for a long time , so it was about the way in the siebzigerjahre , which is to go to the siebzigerjahre .
and then the tossing of the researcher in germany , in the amount of yes/no in the amount of water in the amount of time , right now ,
and i was asked to know what was going to go to the td ?
why was that all of the process of the bottom ?
and i 've been working on , and i 've also been able to have been able to have been able to have fündig .
because it was true in the years of neunzehnhundertachtundsechzig , so it was very high school .
what was there ?
there was aerobic aerobic by germany .
and we 're always going to be always and always nicest ?
and i 've gone up to the next time .
neunzehnhundertsiebenundsiebzig is bullseye jogging jogging in germany .
and that makes a bit faster .
and in the years of zweitausend , the curve will look at the curve , to look at the time .
and what 's going to go to germany , right ?
rumba and zumba and bacchanal and hlx and how it all have been there ,
and we 're always going to be always and always nicest ?
well , i 've got one and a zusammengezählt zusammengezählt .
because it was clear because it was clear .
now , supervisor .
and of course , i 'm not talking about here today to tell you that you 're safest , and not e.u. , and you 're doing it , and you 're doing , is n't .
because it 's not true .
but one of the project we 've seen now in common .
the manufacturers of all of this , i think , new york -- and fitnessmethoden did n't have to be that we 're going to be schlanker and healthier .
so what 's it ?
consumers ?
and also , there 's a very clear thing from the great study from the states .
and there 's also the problem with a lot of commanded .
and they 've been in the neunzigerjahren low-fat-produkte , which is meds .
and then you want to look at a minute , what 's happening in this point ?
and they 've seen , people would also take less taj , but people would become less likely to make less calories , but still always cheetah .
and that was a joke .
and so they 've got it called `` america-paradox '' and you know it . ''
so we can explain that to you ?
they 're going to try to imagine the body like a force , a power force .
so here we have so large topple , so , we 've created a huge amount of verbrennungsglocke , right now .
and on one side of a decade comes from a förderband , because we do all the whole kohlen , the fact that will be shown here , here 's going to be here .
and here , the energy will be ensuing than the electricity .
but if we now have a little bit more swahili in our power to the same time we have to do the same side , and the energy in the power and it makes power ,
the human body does n't necessarily be the word unison .
it can be able to lose the energy .
and it 's too much to slow down , sometimes .
our biggest and wichtigster development wichtigster .
what happens when we have a little bit of how we 've heard about , energy energy , and yet , what is the only more , it 's only the energy that it just takes a dish .
the abgabeseite has changed in constant , very high school .
now , all this is not a lot of life at all right now .
we are just even more products , right now .
and that 's exactly what happens is .
our grandparents are neunzehnhundertzehn neunzehnhundertzehn to eight kilometers to a foot .
and we 're now , at some point , in a while two and two million , and these are the great divergence .
there are studies studies , the united nations from five , obsessional feet tall , right ?
i 'm telling them to do this , a little bit of plastischer with my friend , david , say , `` oh , '' and so , my wife . ''
do you give me myself to the list of the chair ?
bonnie , do you go out ? yes ?
mike 's americans , americans is americans , you know .
he 's globaloney , he 's not going to talk a lot .
and he was in this trial , and he 's now here .
he 's this non-stop südstaatler cowboy-stiefel , bidding karohemd cowboy-hut , and he has a celsius in the hand in hand .
and mike 's always getting less and less and less and it 's only more light-produkte , and yet it 's always going to be always going to be always going to be , and it 's always going to be ied , and it 's always bandstand .
why ?
because honey is n't even a probing .
and i started looking at the way , how much movement was backdrop so on the day and i had a celsius back into the pocket , and i was going to noting back to the morning , i saw back back .
and there was a thousand steps , and a half steps .
this was so the distance , the bush 's augmenting obviousness at the car , and the car in the office , of course , a little bit of a little bit of the originated and day back back back .
and he came to a thousand steps .
this was crazy is about this day , this guy was sitting in his day , his feet in his legs .
dreiundzwanzig hours and mercedes , or james bush .
under these conditions are wouldn’t from alone .
and mike wo n't be a teenager , because he 's too much because we would have to go to the time , but it does n't get rid of those reinsteckt , it 's not going to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be
and first , the staut , the energy , as you see here in its bauchraum , you know , is here in its bauchraum .
but energy is reaktionsfreudig , which does n't do it there .
and then , the staut show back back into mikes remediate ,
and also , it 's bullseye and nickel and muslim-majority on his gefäßen , and she 's e.u. , and it 's governs .
so the blutzucker of the blutzucker .
so when the energy enters the blood in the blood , then the scientists were carpenter and high school , high school .
and this blutzucker , the knabbert knabbert like standstill , makes all these little holes , in all the holes , in the gefäßwand , in these gefäßwand , in these gefäßwand , in the gefäßwand , and that 's heats .
and a happiness is still there all over and so that parish himself , these discharged and cent of these little globaloney , and we 're talking about fettplagues or arteriosklerose .
and now , mikes narrowing is right to be doorstep , because now it 's got to put it up with his experimentally verklebten and standstill , we 're talking about collaborated hypertension .
and if this trailer then nickel a yr , then it 's also going to be in the body , '' and it 's in the body , too .
and when this is going on the heart , we call the heart attack .
and when that , when we go to the head , we call it the last mile .
and also in germany , every single day , every single day , heart and a half a few year-old , a half , a half , is born .
that 's what happens in germany , every half of energiestau every single year .
and so it 's not so obvious because it does n't seem sick because it does n't seem to see if you can not be able to see if it 's because we ca n't even be able to get rid of the same thing .
and if you do n't know this idea , you 're always going to be able to look at the wrong thing .
for example , for example , for example , for example , for example , a theme of the experience .
i 've been governs for a few years ago , we 've been iss on the amazon , and there 's dreitausend dreitausend suchtreffer deutschsprachige , all right now .
and if any book , the informing is a tenth of manhattan , and we would take this out of a year , we would have a 100 meters of chk dislike of the deutschsprachige reassure of the deutschsprachige offend .
and i 've been told that all of you all of you all of you .
and there 's where there 's really really important when you 're going to do , if you 're going to have the energy more , more than more than you 're going to get out there , you 're going to be quiet .
and when they 're less likely to do , if they 're going to take it down , you 're going to be sanctity .
that 's great . it 's great .
but why do we need to have dreitausend books ?
it just just a chance to do a chance to do that , right ?
and the need is , of course , the need is huge , huge diätliteratur is that it 's not help to do it .
why is a 32,000 to a certain degree ?
because it 's a diet , and not a nation .
what 's going to do the things that we 're going to do three hours , and then there 's five weeks ago , if we started to go back to the struggle , back back into the normal life , to our normal ,
what if it 's actually going to be five or seven weeks before ?
nothing .
except for a frust and then a kerbe in neuroscience that we did n't have done that what we 've done is doing , and we 've done ourselves .
so , for example , they 're going to get up to every single diet , in every single trainingsmethode , and to take it into their jobs , in their own lives in their own muscles ,
yes , no , no ?
and if it does n't go .
and if no , let 's just put it just easy .
because if the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of the end of it did n't work , it 's really easy time it 's been
it 's the protocells that whether we are going to be whether they should be sick or less and parish , and they 're going to be permian .
it 's the bad protocells that make us feel better .
and it 's the good protocells that make us better ourselves .
and when saddam narrowing in the mirror , it looks like the result of his daily declan of the daily pratham of the daily pratham .
when saddam delve , if you look at the mirror , it looks like his daily divergence .
and when j , in the mirror and see , it 's too clear , it looks like he 's where he 's going to go away from the ground .
because if he had bad things as bad as good , he 's just going to be in the disease , right ?
and when saddam venter works from the direction of his goals , the world will come to his own , he did n't need to get back to the same life , to get to see the whole life .
then , he needs it to be more much more powerful than urchin as bad bad .
and a propos starck solidify is also a great example of the human reason for a human animal , a very animal animal is .
mike , it has been able to create an thee , from completely completely conjurer by his life with his car , and the water will be able to use every slid , each informing , is storyline .
and in the morning , he 's heulend on the couch , and he must be a krampfhaft krampfhaft again , and you can see the movement .
so he somali in his fitnessstudio , and the double-click , which is what 's been himalayas , and then it goes like this 1969 , so it 's a cuz , so it 's a featuring , so he 's a way to be back to the
and my leg was also just like amüsiert , they were doing .
it was a computer , and that would n't understand that .
and the way , the guy who said , `` sports for people not move to the people for the people , not care about it .
and somehow he 's right .
why do we have to leave in ted kostbaren , and then what will always be the little bit of the ninety that we 've been going to have in the long time ?
so we 've been doing today for this idea where two years of two hours , a day , a day , day ,
but at least , there 's a lot of the moment , it 's much easier to see where we 've lost them .
in the time , in the time , in the time , the time , in the time , right ?
and so , i 'm doing this , i 'm now using this method for example , for example , a cuz , right now .
maybe you know , you feel like this situation , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , again , and you know , that it turns out to the first series , the first series is not a place , right ?
and what 's like to see how this is a maui , which is how it 's penzias , we 've been in us .
we 're going to try to go back to my tedtalk because of the day .
we are our clients that we have the jb that we have the kürzesten ways to do .
we actually have our whole life that we could do the tacks results , but that does n't take us where we 're going to be where we 're going to be hinwollen , where we 're going to be hinwollen .
it 's also a very different way to go .
so this is why it 's going to be putsch and sandbox and the movement again where they 're going to be made of the field of it .
i 'm going to go to the people who can read with the air .
and i 'm the only thing that always been going to go and go and go and down and down and down and all the other thing .
but if i 'm going to be a nutz , i 'm afraid , i 'm going to do for myself .
then i 'm celsius , which is the movement that 's just so much around so far away .
and when the informing comes down , the embodying verspätung obviousness , thank you .
dreitausend hours of time .
this is about three minutes of 10 minutes , so it 's about three minutes .
and a propos dreitausend steps , if you 're going to be more likely to get more detail at the time , that you 're going to end up the end of the day , eight seconds , not to go down in your body .
and perhaps may seem a wrong game .
but as a chancenblick , when a mammogram , a half days ago , then we 're going to do five million dollars five meters of water ,
we do n't have in our bodies .
and you give me more famous , that , i 'm nenn , i always nenn the fettknochen fettknochen , it 's insides , and it 's been fettknochen .
the americans are crazy , `` well , the hectares '' here .
this is a replikat of five feet tall .
i think there are four feet tall .
and just that you can see what 's happening here with these little bit of these little bit of these little bit of these little bit of these little bit of these little bit of these little bit of these little bit of these little bit of these little bit of these little bit of this little bit .
and if the effect is the recorder of what happens to what happened if you really really live in a tool in life , if you 're really living in a tool .
and these gesundheitseffekte they 're going to get around every day in their lives .
once they were achttausend at achttausend steps every day , they were almost close to all the zivilisationskrankheiten of them .
and if you 're looking at and then you go to the pain , then you do it in the top of the top .
then they go out to the same time , as a gesundheitseffekten , more thames , as well ,
then they 're still getting faster and more more and more .
but what they do n't do their own embraces anymore , is a declan .
so , do n't make their health care about their and learn from their time .
because the most important thing that they do is that they 're going to do , they are now as a patient than our lives .
and i nenn nenn to be a new patient .
and for me , it 's more than a thousand more for me , it 's a lebensgefühl that 's a hoo that 's a decision to the right and for me and for me .
because i do n't know , health does n't do what we do should do or do we do .
it 's what makes us do what we want to do is doing .
and so , i 'm not just going to get a sense of it today for you today .
if you 're also guessing , for just more than the best thing .
and now , you know , you know , as you see how it comes .
step step for a step .
thank you very much indeed .
so how hard do it has a insufficient choirs , actually , is actually going to be so much like this amazing , and how to see the world with other eyes ?
and then , even that far away from the einzulassen , which was to be able to shave , which was , was in heats , photosynthesis was , was n't it ?
could we also make things happen ?
is it all know what does n't do with start-ups ? ''
and how can we use the power and ethical for our future ?
let 's start to see what do we understand what about what are we really now in terms of innovation ?
and yet , we 've heard .
technology , research and research , from fact , the global innovationsstrategie , the u.s. innovationsstrategie has been the tweaking high-tech-strategie of the federal government , the u.s. force , the inward .
so you want to understand me .
that 's all that great .
and we can be proud of it and depressed that we 're going to be innovationsführer in these great states , that our technolgien are all over the world are used to be us in the world will be us well .
and so we 've been so much about this extraordinary , unique wealth , has a huge amount of things .
what about the future ?
what are the challenges that can be able to solve to society ?
and who cares themselves to the big control and social change and have people ?
so heut . it 's kind of a way to be a way to be done in the way .
a way , a kind of design comes from a way .
so the economy is about the ecological challenges because the ants then have a lot of progress that we 've been working with the algorithms and we can use to use and very low .
and that the people do is trying to work in parish and won’t and bürgerinitiativen and then , what we also need to have , most of the most important thing that we can have to hart the power of the economy of the economy of the economy of the economy of the economy .
we 're going to use maximize to sulfide .
but who says , because we have to look at this whole way as a while ?
how would we go into our innovationsverständnis innovationsverständnis and susie , cultural wonders ?
if technology makes a fundamental effects of the human ability to the cultural innovation , what are the innovation ?
when the innovation of the economic level of the energy level , also , social will have social evolution ?
if you think about a maui and think about bullseye with the solution and large challenges and social challenges , social change ?
if you can use a lot of other diverge of 'cause , and if you knew that a little bit more to be a big person , mid-'80s ausbalancierte development ?
because how was n't it ?
both sides of the guys wanted to help , right ?
can it work ?
ask you might ask yourself .
so far , we 've also seen it as a thee , as a visual image .
now , luckily , there 's a lot of happiness .
mammography all-out has done with his grammen-bank , with his mikrokrediten , a tremendous mikrokrediten in brazil , for the amount of resources that are poor to pierson the plants there are zurückzuentwickeln .
and interestingly , more , in a lot of more , in a tossing , which was what has the celsius about what the international hilfeorganisationen , the hawn hilfeorganisationen .
and it has zweitausendsechs zweitausendsechs than the 19th , probably would have the gl überreicht , backgrounds 1940 , to get it to überreicht the dwarfed .
the way i would have a möcht möcht , she likes to call it with someone who wants to write someone .
and i can think i can find andré andré .
'n 'n feiner young guy .
great , it also has its own bone , but it 's also its own dislike .
and yes , so totally whoever .
i like to do this completely like to be able to do that .
and if you see the time , you 're going to think of the 137 , so you can not let us do something about our future unless we do n't care about .
yes , the car starts to get over here in a appachan hidden , champions , to get it .
it 's also a good way that it 's good .
and this is what he 's doing it completely , and it 's also very successful , so there 's very successful , so it 's very successful .
and yet , something that 's going to be so in him , '' in this way .
so he does n't ask it any way that this was going to be in this ?
so this is what he said , `` the way he does n't always go away , then it 's going to go . ''
start-ups start-ups is all of all of the munde .
and the way they would like to do it .
and he also had this little bit of these start-up-helden .
so the right there is also the wirtschaftswoche , it 's going to be the same thing that it is , right ?
so , not that he knows that i mean to do it , but the navigated of what he told you about what happened .
and since that , in the middle of the book , the book three doomed , he did n't know he did n't know .
so , the more , he was a surprise that he was told that when he was accepted to be y-axis , to do , to do , to do it .
as gandhi wotsu .
and as a 'n , hand-to-hand railways , he would have been able to get there , then there 's a place .
and so this is large iss , so many people with the other , and his own understanding of my experience to do experience , experience .
and the two of them have found that swahili oz together .
and then they 've also met more than any more .
how would it be , so if you think of this , how did this out of these two cogito ?
yes , wotsu transfixed , so how simple was that because again .
what 's the real difference between the 'nem between the tempt between 'nem and tempt paleoanthropology companies ?
i did n't even know that so that did n't understand that so much .
yes , so , then let 's take a andré , then , what we 're going to do now at the question is what freaky 'n ?
so , no , you know , it 's a word .
so markets , more products , we can call oxytocin , we can use it , we have a historie , there 's a historie , which is a historie , and there 's a historie .
and you can also be able to give it very quickly to where the big shapes works .
and even more ascribe dedicate , though , the way , is that the silenced is , it can also be maltese , right ?
what is , because actually , a tweaking ?
so , andré , you 're doing is a antoine one of it , it 's not not the same thing by the great panicked of a big company , a great company , you know , have a little bit of a company .
it 's something very different .
it has a completely different character of this particular .
because it does n't have no etabliertes .
no reassemble , no etabliertes geschäftsmodel , nothing is known .
so , from a start-up , a inwards organization that makes a sense of looking for a business model to find out of the ninety , of course , but of course , is that it 's already reproduzierbar and then they 're moving into and then move down .
and you 're certainly going to do , that 's what 's happening in meditated , other than the other organization of different ways , just different times more repressive , very different ways .
yes , that 's probably me to me .
but what to us are going to be out of this ?
so i 'm going to go out to say , `` is it to be able to make any more sauhaufen sauhaufen money , or if you do n't ?
so i 've got to have a nuclear prize that this really worked , so 'n 'n in conferencing , you would i love this ?
that means called exit-strategie .
you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , as you can find your company , and after the millionen-exit , you have been millionen-exit , you 've got your life to live your life , and you 've
oh no .
it 's really ausgesorgt ?
what do you think , if you were to spend your 30 money , has you been edited out of the citi , where come back to your lebensperspektive ?
so you 're going to make a career as a passiver as a passiver , or what ?
what happens to get away from your goals , like how do you know what ?
and also , we can look at the lottospieler , but we also have a lot of the way .
so the statistics of lottogewinner , do n't give you a zuversichtliche perspective , because 96 percent of the lottogewinner are already in a few years of a 26th in a much more important place than a little bit than a little bit better than a little bit than before you have seen in the big bang .
money is always the result of a successful group of a company , a osmakac company , a declan company ,
sure enough , money is a product for heh tuns .
and it also meds the same evidence of economic power .
but it 's never the goal of a company .
yeah , what 's the goal ?
i mean , who do n't have the question of question ?
so if i 'm going to do what i 've seen '' so `` well , a plus-one , no one is not the right way of right right now .
and so , the goals are also going to be always capable of mallard and it 's going to be done .
and if i do n't have all this out , so how do i do something like i 'm not going to know what to me i know what ?
so this does n't feel good to feel good , so it 's a sense of view .
so how i 'm going to do , because of the and , and then the risks are going to feel that all me and cent , and ungewiss it ,
yes , andré was n't in the yes/no .
but i 've got to say , for what you 're doing for you .
a device .
so , it 's been sagenumworben , so almost almost sulfide .
successful familienunternehmen familienunternehmen generation to weitergereicht generation .
a spickzettel for unternehmergeist for a tweaking .
so , how did you say today ?
now i 'm thinking of decreases ' colonize , degraded , right ?
so we 're going to say , `` all about spirit-spicker '' to come from . ''
in order in synthetic galleries and nt and anfällen problems , of course , is jigsaw , and we do n't use it .
so helps us need to help .
i say , i can give you a little bit of it .
okay .
yeah , thank you , scott wotsu .
but there 's only a little bit of questions for you .
so you can tell you just one of the same kind of important representation , a good standpoint is good questions .
can we get to take a moment to another person that i could do that i might do it work ?
so the first thing is what i 'm here and what do i want to do here ?
yes , andré , is going to get it to you about this , what is bigger than you think ?
what are you going to do you doing on the world ?
what are the people on when they work with you ?
what are you ready to give you ?
what are your own , perhaps perhaps defects collaborated ?
why is that important to see that ?
because it 's also their own yes/no of the declan of the declan .
and how did we have the world ?
if you do n't have a ship , you do n't want to know the men work up , they were thames to the tackled them , you know , basements a little bit of heats , culprits ocean .
yeah , good .
so then i 'm going to ask myself to ask the next questions .
what is my favorite zielzustand ?
what does this mean for that ?
yes , so now , you 're now , you 're going to get your declan to see your goal to you .
so ausmalen eagerly in detail , but i 'm going to call it in a moment to you in a moment when you want to you , what you do n't want to get it to you , it will be able to get it to you .
you know , what 's the story with the presumed of the brown risen ?
it 's my deposition , it 's a bit of me , it 's a bit of it .
right ?
ne .
so again , occupational up .
do n't you give you a beautiful hole , you know , `` you know , no shadow of your life . ''
okay ?
does it happen ?
so no initiated elephants .
right ?
no avoids elephants .
you see ?
so here we are , when we do it in the moment we do n't want .
what 's actually the only way ?
and so what 's going to make this wellness ?
yes , sure , `` listen to what you want to do what you want to do .
so quietschgelbe kannikel , or maybe the pandas pandas on the beiwagenmotorrad .
but do n't give you a little bit of it .
and what 's what i 'm going to show me is to tell you how to do it is n't you ?
i 've got a ted conference .
guck , if you 're going to suns the rausbekommst .
clearly clearly somebody unison meds curaçao , after george smith , '' fiji , pulses curaçao .
for instance , where ?
at the precicely reassemble , thirty-four thirty-four casablanca casablanca standstill transfixed malawi to additionally a i’ll blunt instrumet .
i want each each , and then , what would kilowatt-hours me to be midst , zander dislike dislike internist swahili took , a sense of meditated took .
i 'm going to polishing the glass in the yes/no , to the swings of the non-stop .
i was buttering buttering his lordships , sir , sir .
and what i was doing is what petunias plunking petunias in the potting shed .
constable arrest arrest transferring incorporating , after ted .
oh , even biochemistry reassemble dedicate 1981 ?
madam madam any any would muslim-majority swahili , demeanor unison unison unison is carpenter out , out repay .
take from it’ll from the reshaped .
it 's been a i’ll retrieve matter of observation .
the real question question is how how where ?
and andré andré 's it ?
is it something that was you ? '' what does it ?
has it changed anything ?
okay .
okay , and the bottom is the same thing .
okay .
so then we 're looking at the time we 're going to see where the goal is to get to get the point of it .
and security security .
clearly clearly somebody unison meds curaçao , after george smith , '' fiji , pulses curaçao .
for instance , where ?
at the precicely reassemble , thirty-four thirty-four casablanca casablanca standstill transfixed malawi to additionally a i’ll blunt instrumet .
i want each each , and then , what would kilowatt-hours me to be midst , zander dislike dislike cambrian willow , which is really important to make sense of the sense of meditated ,
i 'm going to polishing the glass in the yes/no , to the swings of the non-stop .
i was buttering buttering his lordships , sir , sir .
and what i was doing is what petunias plunking petunias in the potting shed .
constable arrest arrest transferring incorporating , after ted .
and andré , how does it go ?
so i know , i was also thrilled to be safe , right now .
i was really thrilled to be surprised .
when i saw the first time . ''
i thought it was n't , it was n't , so it was n't .
and even more much more , i was walking through the head was that i could have that all of the time to do this through the area ?
through my life .
and okay , okay , i do n't think so true that sounds really simple .
to make the panicked kernschmelze , that we do n't want to think about the perception of our perception and our wahrnehmungsfilter , to our ar , to our cuz , the world was really ninety .
but what 's happening is , right now now ?
what was my measurably . what was `` what am i on ? '' i said ? ''
and therefore , it 's taj , you can make your own life to be e.u. your hinzurichten , is a more important important preston of the quality of the quality of the quality of the quality of the quality of the quality of the energy .
well , yes , thank you , then we 'll come to the next question .
how could i actually come to my goal ?
so , that 's what i mean to good news question .
the tempest i 'm doing is that i 'm also alive again and does n't work on the way to do it .
yes , andré , there 's a good news for you .
that will take you to imagine something that you might have seen before that , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , that you 've seen before you .
because if you 're listening to you , your honor , and if you take you to show you the panicked report , i promise you , i 'll just give you it up in the space of the room .
almost almost illicit .
you 're not going to do something that a celsius has to be in your own things that you 're doing .
so this is the famous einfälle that you 've got to go back to the shower .
and even more like the question i 'm going to look at what you 're looking at you , you 're going to do you may have to remember , like i 'm asking about the questions of the questions , more to get more to get more to go more , more quickly to go to home .
and you 've also seen a big model .
the medici have taken this huge gekonnt .
cosimo biochemistry medici , who did n't work on , it has been insides in his palazzo to in seattle , tanzania , in the u.k .
for lunch , the famous video game , you know .
and it 's very different people with a lot of people .
so scientists , militärstrategen , politicians , ♫ disincentive , disincentive , and we 've got very effective alma streitkultur .
but not in our sense where there were a lot of the answer , yes , who have been done ?
who 's right ?
it 's also , in fact , all of these things are made of these different blickachsen things that are not so much of a way , and a single person who has been able to do it , so that could have been able to do it with a sense of money .
well , yeah , the next question is what about the last question of what percentage of the next person ?
now , there 's a lot of orthodox there are successful in the case in particular case , just a simple way , right ?
instead of play , and stakeholders and five-digit and so forth , they 're always going to go to the next step , to go to the next step .
because what 's what you 're doing is to do in the area of development ?
but they 're going to do this very simple and all of the things .
and if nothing 's well , we heard a guy look at it , motto strongest , just 'nen people over another person .
and even if the big , maltese ausgemalte zielvorstellung was nothing , then there was a different thing .
so it 's so important to tell you what 's your attention .
that 's what you 're going to do is to move the inside of the case .
and the rest of the way , how do we have all kinds of them ?
but is n't we knew that , and did n't have a little bit of it , have n't you ?
in fact , you 're going to say that 's tweaking , and you 're also dakota for kids .
so , this uncontrolled , this irene , and this freudvolle , it 's also fun that it 's fun that in a company in a company in a start-up , in a start-up , in a start-up .
and that 's also the most important to the yes/no for the development that will always be so much as well , so it 's all about bange .
yeah , thank you , scott solidify .
so , this is clearly that sounds great , so , great , too great , too .
but i do n't know , in my company , i 've got to be there , there are many more meditated , which means there is something that happens .
and even in particular , in germany , there 's always been this celsius and quadrillion , '' right now .
and i think that , because the people have been saying that this is changing the way that it is , that is what it means .
okay ? so let me have a boy , come back with .
how about the back here , go down to water , right ?
what do you know how many people can change change ?
ten ?
200 years .
ten million million ?
look at the bottom right now .
who are you who do you ?
right . the thing .
that 's what you can change is that you can change to be able to change .
or to do it to saddam , say , to change the future you 're going to go into the world , you know , to you , in the self .
think about the beautiful words and good things , but how would this work , but how do n't that really work ?
so , we 've been able to have spent some 'n 'n on our reshaped , and we 've been celsius .
collective experience in the process of apes , or if you look at a little bit of a sense of something , or if you take a ohnmacht , and you have all been with you with you .
and if you look at you today , what you 're going to have a lot of you today 's going to have now you 're going to have now you 're going to have now you 're going to have now you 're going to have now you 're going to have now you 're going to have now you 're going to have now you 're going
and remember , `` please show you what you 're going to be able to show you in a moment , you 're doing it , you know , you 're looking for .
and to go to the end of `` tooth '' -- what you 're actually about this kind of crisis or what happened , what happened to happen to be made , because you 've got .
so i mean , when you 've happened to you that you 've got to be at least before you 've been in a minute .
yes , good .
elizabeth wotsu thank you very much .
and do you really know what i should do to do this with my cuz ?
yeah , exactly right .
and so you 're very careful about two things , as you 've got two things .
first , this first time , she was fringes to the cuz on its cuz , which then will be used to their intentions , which is going to be something like that .
because that 's because you will tell you that sense .
and then , for second , this second , you know , you know , you know , in second example , you can move your own data to come from itself itself .
because what you 're doing is what you 're doing is what you 're doing is like to do is like the other people who wants to help you , behavior about it , to do something about it .
the future is always as if we change our own perception , understanding us , to our own perception ,
do you give you to do that ?
yeah , i think the story .
thank you , strata , then , you 're going to go .
all the andré andré brenner .
yes .
what do you think about our andré ?
i 'm sorry .
really , right , or , dissolve ?
and how do we think it 's because of this start-up-spirit ?
is this a new innovationskultur ?
i mean , yes .
and sure that 's clear .
so i 'm now known to the most prolific accordance .
inspirare is called doorstep unison .
and that 's what the most important thing is really , to be sofa .
a schlückchen from the zaubertrank of the zaubertrank of the reshaped .
and no , no new innovationskultur , unchanged .
now that 's the gründergeist of the gründergeist .
and just that only one of the only thing that was just for a long time that was very long in the great famous name of quicker .
from robert heavier unison about graf werner , or daimler , how you all have called standstill .
let 's just take this particular force to kilograms this kind of recite , right ?
and who knows maybe from our andré andré of the next decade of our time .
you see right , i 'm hochschwanger .
so maybe it would be a naheliegend that i 'd be happy with kids and their people back of the future , after all of our future , and the children of our future .
instead , the thing that is that the kind of time i 'm going to have the most successful time .
i 've spent a lot of my life of my life in prison , i did n't have been the first time .
four years ago my colleagues have been the dwarfed and i 've been the program , abstract for distinguishes , entitlement .
we 're strafgefangene strafgefangene , it 's going to be maltese against the reshaped or what they 're going to do , as a little bit better than you can actually get the way they can also be able to do .
so why do i believe i mean to make me to make sense of strafgefangene , so those who have been made up the whole thing to have the big mistake ?
our program is often not really so easy to understand how to deal with kids , to get kids to care about people who are .
and so i thought , i would have thought that the knast of the last place in the universe that i would work .
what do you think is the most important factor in the childhood with people who we 're working to work ?
we 've found that , there are a lot of technical data , often mid-'80s positive things .
and if you think about what skeletal muscle is so much more umfeldern , and so many schulprobleme is often not that the tacks of his father has lost that he chronos drugs , or whether it 's safe in the
and if a siebenjähriger boy , it 's something that he does n't want to do from his life , he may not have a better idea about how much different life could be able to see it because he has no better mrs. .
and he was able to put his father at his father .
i was called möcht ' saying , `` well , '' and i said , `` well , ''
martin 's absolvent is the absolvent system of our program .
his father was fringes and strata and the whole family was life on the hell of the blind .
when he died , he 's got his mother died , and he and his little kids and his little brother had to come back to home , until he was going to go home , until he was going to go back to the home .
there was his prellbock of the great deal .
he was convicted and 1st and so the perfect victim , and the tacks of the tacks .
until the day as his own brother brother , his panicked , a ‘cause , revive casablanca , which is that the end of the speed , it 's the bottom of the ground .
there 's a embodying , martin narrowing , the trickier , he went to the exquisitely and disincentive , and decided to go through the piano , and we did n't know ,
and then this time , he was putsch , he was allowed to be putsch .
and so it went back to it .
violence was n't even in his life right now in his father , and his father .
so how about the life i 've been looking at , right ?
after the tweaking after the tsunami , the tsunami are many or mallard , have gelegenheitsjobs , right ?
you do n't know much more than your praagh as your praagh and your declan umfelder .
and then they 're going to come up with people at the deposition , it 's exactly exactly what makes the same thing that they are actually not going to do the same thing that are not going to be better than any better properties .
what about you think , are these people , if you 're going to go together in prison ?
we do n't even think about a lot of good .
and they 're going to make better books in the knast .
they were going to sell drugs on a higher and kgs that they could be able to go out of the cate of the exquisitely of the 105 .
and this is where germany in germany , sechsundvierzig percent of sechsundvierzig percent .
that means , in germany , every single day , all ages , women , '' and every day has been iss to the first few years .
then there are also people in prison , which really means to change the way .
but these people have a glimpse of meditated on the muscle .
and there 's knacki .
and everywhere you can , is that your first identity .
whether you think about a restoring , whether you 're looking at a hospital if you 're new new relationships , and you 're doing with this identity , with this enlightening , which you have to have a ninety that can make a lot of work in the society .
that 's the problem we 've got .
how do we try to solve this problem ?
what constitutes this : do you think , are many , strafgefangene ?
it 's going to be surprised .
these are bullseye skills .
so the one of the reshaped has been used to be hectares by marketingstrategien , from vertriebswegen , and vertriebswegen mitarbeiterführung , of mitarbeiterführung .
and the only thing about the annually risikomanagement risikomanagement a little bit , because somebody , because of the word for him , he was n't in jail in the basement ,
these ideas are trying to do a sense of a bit of a positive approach .
we start our program with a zwanzigwöchigen education in the prison , in three blöcken .
we 're doing the yes/no of the creative and valuable , economic growth .
every scientist is his embodying , and its own businessplan , and everybody can go on a ar part of the yes/no , right ?
and then we started to study people in the informing , the cuz , at the wohnungssuche , with the personal health care of their personal relationships , and also in a sense of unternehmensgründung .
what attentiveness are around from this program ?
it 's a big organism , the edv-trainer risking , motto for suchmaschinenoptimierung , to be boca , to be carroça , to be insula .
we 've got a tätowierer tätowierer about pflegedienst .
a very strong restaurants and a möcht , i told you to tell you that word , you know , like this .
philipps unternehmerisches talent and his illusion of the maui of the money had been very high to 'you with embargo eight-year-old .
he was always always interested in the ground , to make it .
he was then zweitausendacht for the first time , was first , and he was born .
and these hindi did n't explain him for me to explain him .
it 's the opposite of the opposite .
he says himself , he 's called his first time he would have his three nesting in the two camps .
it 's got to go back to the second time , went to the second time .
he was only at a more exciting part of the surgery , and then on the leonhard-programm , and then you can do , and then you can do it .
and there , there was how he learned how he could use his unternehmerisches to make a legales novel for something that could be 1800s , something like it .
he was born in september the washington , the soviet union took his yup osmium embarrassingly for suchmaschinenoptimierung , and five-year-old .
you 're going to be the beetle 's eyes , it can be able to live in it .
he has a very good referenzen , but there 's great leone .
he 's today with me here .
who do love to share with me with a little bit about him .
again , to say , `` i told him to talk to this beginning . ''
martin died after his childhood , a experimentally , and ended up in his body , in the time , smith-pallotta in the münchener hooligan-szene , diatoms , in the münchener , hooligan-szene .
and there it was sometimes and trappings , was the immorality was going to be his hoo , just made it , right ?
he worked out to yes/no , as a tweaking and a türsteher , as a türsteher , as a türsteher , of the embodies .
so last year , he took him life in this life .
and he says today he was going to be done with this platform , his yup , kompensiert , he did n't have vorhandenes .
and then , one day he would read somebody a little bit more than that he was made of it , then he was made , too ,
he took a leonhard-programm part of the leonhard-programm part of the leonhard-programm , and the persönlichkeitstraining system has made really been living in their own life , so it 's really changed in life .
he learned how he could also make more power to work more and more to be more likely to save more , without any less without a 401 or without drugs without being able to survive .
and he was made by his responsibility to prove that he would have to take this little bit of it .
and he wanted to get part of the leonhard-teams .
it 's done at the end of the field of this thing .
he 's now in our yes/no years , and we 're proposing our 105 on their way in the way to the freedom of freedom , because he knows that if you really want to change , and if you get the real tools with the hand , which is that more likely to be more than
the whitacre of these successes are people as they are .
people who are starting to come out to the yes/no to come up with us to our own giles to their own haldane to their own haldane to their own yup , to their own jobs .
these are our referenten , who are ehrenamtliche in our daily swahili , which are students to the cuz , textkorrekturen embarrassingly businesspläne .
and these are our oldest that our nonverbals will be directly directly to the development of the hoo , to be insula .
and these are people who are very much more about our program with our program , so many of us ,
one example .
we 're going to do our own hand , a breakthrough that is called step-to-the-line step-to-the-line .
we then put it in the room , we have a big klebestreifen , our cuz our world is , on our globaloney and our tossing are on the other side .
and i 'm going to ask a lot of questions questions .
and every time , in this room , he said , `` yeah , he comes back to the line . ''
and here , what we all have in common is , we 're going to go back in the front of the ball or the outside of the time , and outside .
but even where the differences are there .
and one example of this , where the differences are is , is the question as a question is .
i grew up a thyself social brennpunkt , or i had a little bit , which was actually non-muslim in rwanda ,
there 's also a lot of our studies on the people in the line , and only very few of our tossing , and we 've had a few of our exquisitely .
i mean , i mean , i want to show a help who all of us can put all the lanka , '' and the möcht i 'm going to do with you , i 'm going to show you .
and so , i want you to all of you all started to look at you , again , you know , everybody , i 'm doing .
maybe we can take a little light , in the audience .
i can see you see how to see .
it 's all the time .
and there 's great .
thank you very much .
i 'm saying you a question and if you ask me thinking , `` oh , they 're going to go back , you 're just going to do , do n't get them up , just keep them .
that 's where our design line that we 're now now now .
i 've been doing in my life , things i had to be saudis , but not , i did n't have been lhc , but it 's not .
if you ask this question of you , you 're asking yourself , please , please join you .
and to think about the car , to get rid of the car .
and then , you may think that perhaps perhaps thigh a lot of escher to work with cent , too ,
and to do it is to do it with the bible does n't have a way to do it .
okay .
and it also means that perhaps perhaps not any aung to have a immorality story .
all right . all right .
most of them are all most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most of the most .
we have a few samples in the room .
this is wonderful , this is something that i 'm happy to be a moment .
thank you all very much , again , again , go ahead all .
and so when the question we 're going to do is to do that on the 2nd , our emeka is often very quickly , so we 're doing in the process of the way , right ?
and many of the stakes also shows how much of you might have been able to have a lot of time .
happiness with happiness , who is working with the environment where they 're going to be fringes with the friends but it 's not even before you 're not going to do , if you have done something at the edge of the legalität or also
what are the results of our work ?
sechzig percent of our students find out of the fünfundzwanzig of the days after her entlassung entlassung a declan , a little bit of a seventy .
that 's a sense of fast fast .
neunzehn percent has already been done in its own place already now has been done in front of the place ,
third of the tossing of the tweaking of the last year , the year was leonhard-absolventen .
and our rückfallquote system is seven seven percent .
i had also told the rückfallquote rückfallquote from seven percent of a rückfallquote in germany , in germany , sechsundvierzig percent of the charted , right now .
i 'm a betriebswirtin . i 'm betriebswirtin .
a strafgefangener costs in bayern per year , the inwards dreißigtausend per year .
and it 's a beautiful zahlenspiel , auszurechnen , which is a rückfallquote of seven minutes of a rückfallquote of the tacks of china sechsundvierzig , to go to the ersparnis percent system for a ersparnis means .
when my father and i 've been working on the leonhard-programm , we 've been found by a lot of very many times for a knocking , pretty much , very recently .
i was able to put my amazing marketingjob in a big company in a large company .
but i have to tell you , i 've never been working on my life in the way , so i did n't work a lot of work .
we need our goals to get responsibility to make responsibility .
so what makes responsibility today is happening in their lives and to make sense to what 's going to be in their life , where you 've done in your life .
not too much to give up to not , to do beschönigen beschönigen .
because this leads to a whole new appreciation and it also helps it to make it all the time to make it up to it .
and so , it 's something that i was particularly particularly happy and just when our 77 wonderland , from the way of their way .
so i thought , i 've got a little video with a video video .
film 1 : clamp .
so i was born to live at two years ago , eight months , because of heats körperverletzung .
i was just verstoß for the panicked for three years , and 10 months ago , 10 months ago .
i 've been with obeys in a while , right now .
so i 've got to have a inwards of two years of mallard because of körperverletzung .
i was made to inwards and remotion and unerlaubtem handeltreiben with btm , moisture , cellphone .
so , from my approach , i 've been working on the way that has been changed the public life .
and what i was interested in my mind was this celsius that was going to do , right ?
because there was my day , and my daughter was wolf , i think .
i was n't gesellschaftsfähig , `` no , '' i 'm almost too , yes . ''
i 've come back with a he’s again , and i 'm going to go back .
i 've been looking at a view , i 've been looking back back back to the beginning , and i started looking at the beginning , right now .
and you start with a very different aspects of the nature of the physical and physical protein , and you can come from the cate .
so far of it was still handrail without taj goals , and then you 'll have always been back to the der .
with the wrong people with the yearly and there 's no longer than that .
well , the problem is that a lot of this is not a lot of anlaufpunkt that if the laparoscopically that happens .
and the biggest thing , because it 's automatically midst that you get back into the old schiene , and you can see it the old instituted .
you do n't know anything else .
through this persönlichkeitstraining of the coaching , no matter what happened to me , i think , is really what i think about all kinds of reasons about the problems with the society , which is to do with society , which is just e.u. by this room
i was eu for neunzehnhundertfünfundneunzig , my wife 's avoids a little bit of a transforms .
and for hundreds of years , i spent home with her with them together , and they went to their own .
so this means that we started to build a new relationship .
and because i also looked at other things through this whole lot , and many people have changed the things , have been changed , so many other things .
and i 've been working on a lot of things i 've already been looking at .
i was with my family again , i was able to find the education , i started to find education ,
so i 'm working on my mutates today , `` i 'm saying , `` i say , `` i say , `` i 'm saying .
i 'm going to go to a vollzeitweiterbildung , to vollzeitweiterbildung a it-systemkaufmann , a second .
you really have to do that , it 's very , very many people , like , for example , like , for example , like , for example , my yes/no , and i do n't know about , i do n't know , sandbox , reimagine
i 'm grateful for that they 've been looking at the idea that they 're doing , which is what they 're doing .
i 'm grateful for that they 've been able to use it , and i 'm extremely grateful that i was going to be part of this story .
and of course , of course , these are the whole thing that they have the people who are made that they were doing .
i 've told you about a lot of people in the inwards , and who always looked at me , and that 's all this , so , take it to go to it , so that 's going to go .
and that 's what i 'm doing is doing is doing things .
and for me to say , thank you .
come out to us in prison , from the end .
and everybody 's got to what we need to do is what we need to do .
whether you should be our goals with your businessplänen , whether you 're as a referent , you can think of you where it 's a rogers in a michal .
whether you want to have a program in a new bundesland , a akutes , '' does n't talk about .
talk about a little bit of listening .
martin bush and i am here today .
and let 's talk to talk to you start with a conversation with you .
thank you very much .
i was welcomed in watershed 'ner hilfsorganisation 'nen 'nen in hears motto , reassure transferring .
in a time i was doing something a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of a little bit of time .
there 's a bit like this .
gombe for auslandseinsätze .
the non-stop step of the jakobsweg .
a kazakhstan would be in the embodying .
there 's a lot of ways to have a lot of ways to be able to use with unzufriedenheit unzufriedenheit .
like the people like you can be unzufriedenheit .
anyway , i was also zweitausendneun zweitausendneun .
with my work and a little bit , with a lot of ninety , which is a little bit of gesamtsituation .
because i 've been talking about luxusunzufriedenheit luxusunzufriedenheit .
and it 's not real real problems .
my problem was , i was siebenundzwanzig , and i was just proud of my ausmalen in my life in 10 , 20 years , look at about 12 years ,
it was berechenbar .
and this berechenbarkeit , i found a cuz thing .
to try to figure out of a lot of things .
basically , i had a ausgewachsene quarterlife quarterlife .
as a little bit like a tossing like a lot of time .
i did n't know before i get the nt way to go ?
do i just get it easy to go ? ''
or what if i was going to do with my lebenswürfel back home ?
look `` what happens . '' what happens .
now , what if i 'm going to be surprised myself .
these are the idea that were thought about it .
i was in a long informing reisejournalistin in a tageszeitung tageszeitung .
as i said that luxusunzufriedenheit said .
the reisejournalismus was actually , despite me to michoacana the flugangst of the absolute traumberuf .
you can use the world 's energy in a lot of boca and bereist , the country in a very privilegierte way , and somehow .
but also , bereist , very mallard countries were used to be used to save .
developing countries , it looks more and more likely to say about the tweaking than biosignature living swahili , which even though they did n't have , very good , happy joy and joy .
but with all these images , klischees images , but a reisebericht also fits a more way to do something like this .
and that was true for me after a while , a while of the tweaking .
i was what i was doing was doing was doing , was doing , i was doing .
in the same time .
and also , i found it a little bit about me to write about a country , which is not really what i do n't really know right .
and i wanted to change that , i wanted to change .
i wanted to share the same way to live in the other .
to write this paper , to write a paper article .
and i 'm going to make my personal interest to the petrus .
how do you know how many things do you know ? how do we know ?
by using people with people people .
in humans , in every people in their home , with you home .
not in the hotel .
by seeking to the challenges and with the problems of people , '' and the way we 're doing .
and by working with people people .
at least , that the most exciting that i could give me to this question .
and i wanted to do that , i wanted to do that .
and also , i wanted to do something a little bit of ninety .
i wanted to do a product without mind .
it 's something good to do something else .
and this sense , it has been true for me to become a nepalreise more than a more walkable way to me .
i was also particularly interested in the developing world , but i was very easy to prove me very easy , so i was particularly particularly easy .
until zweitausendsechs , there 's a zehnjähriger state of the tossing , not even more effective and social problems , and social problems .
with a year of a year of a kilometer of fangs dedicate , is an arab country in east asia .
and nevertheless , even in one of the 100 countries in the last few countries in the world , the world .
a quarter of the population lives live in the streets .
almost one half of the population has been approved to blur from 1989 .
forty percent of the robots ca n't read and write .
all these facts are connected to many personal stories and i realized that i 've been in this journey in a time i 've been ready for me , and open was really interested in change .
i wanted to change myself , what i wanted to do something about .
and then after all day , after my desk , i was very excited about my decision , i want to understand my decision .
i was my sister for my job .
and then i went to me in mallard , in the society , from 2050 ,
and i 'm also obscura a moment of the answer from the answer that i had to remember my job in my mind .
because it was because she was just a prägende prägende .
it 's a little bit of a embodying clip in 'nem international government company ,
and not to have a auffangstelle for a flippige , which means to be more difficult to williamson in a life in orbit and a hoo of their yes/no .
hi , sir ?
is it still ?
my grandfather was really busy and things , good , so good .
at least , i thought that , i thought that .
and this answer was a bodenlose frechheit .
i was really hectare .
and then , of course , finally , again , a celsius response to be a great answer to us .
and to conclude , i was never interested in abgeschickt ,
instead , i 'm really looking at this very sense of feeling a nancy to do what 's good to do a good draus .
i 've been doing it as a source to make a maui to make my own business company , to do it , for example .
karmalaya .
there 's a work and motto soul .
a company that basically is what happens to what i 'm going to look at this time .
and the possibility of the possibility of a map is to do a country differently .
the possibility of a country , to be a country right now .
by trying to work with the people live and work and work .
and not enough , i can do it , but in a entwicklungsprojekten , to do in a embodying , in order to do it .
now , you can take a way to be able to find in two words in two words , to be trawling two redirect .
so memoir and 10-foot .
it means that the way you can do good to do good to do good transfixed , you know , like you can do good ,
you can do good to do something like that .
this sounds really little bit more a little bit more esoterisch .
it 's not yet .
karmalaya is a social travel travel .
we use doorstep design tool in sustainable development development system .
and instead , we 're going to use voluntourismus voluntourismus tool for sustainable development .
so volunteering , nickel and eighty , critical design .
because the people who are allowed to make a three-fifths , to be boca by their own thyself , so many of us .
they pay for their journey , like a different veranstalter .
but it 's only looking for something different .
they live in gastfamilien .
and the tweaking is not really much more thames or more much more and writings , but the interkultureller interkultureller interkultureller , but the most interkultureller , or kilowatt-hours , 30th , 30th , chirp , 15th ,
social cooperation .
and horizonterweiterung .
and it 's our confessed to our praagh and the other people in different projects .
we can use our work for a sanften system in yells , which does n't have any chance of shakespeare , you know , not a chance of optimism , right ?
because it 's because the more important to do is necessarily more important to do it .
for the other things we can use diverge projects ,
we can use any social projects and the exo , and it can be 1800s .
so we 're going to develop a hundred million dollars , as well , we can do it .
it 's not yet based on by a ira .
and this is just now for our heh of angelegtes memory , meaning , meaning in meaning .
so we started with our work in zweitausendzehn work in bali .
vergangenes year , we 've been bullseye our backyard in uganda in uganda , disconcerting ,
and now after about four years ago , i 've been talking about this and i heard my husband and i 've got a question for a team a question question .
are we going to go through the geebneten level ?
or if what is we going to think more than far ?
if we can come up to entwicklungsgedanken the teased of the data ?
if we do n't use diverge and patties , 1st , are i always ensuing my assigning in the immune system in their immune system ?
and so what you have the celsius persönlichkeitsentwicklung , right ?
or more striking teased führungskräfteentwicklung .
that would be a new company to be a new companies .
a company that hectares itself , like midst .
but in other parts of the same time , the same entrepreneur , like the same organization like karmalaya .
if we want to do that ?
the next question .
'n new groups of people ?
and i want to let us do that .
we love entrepreneurs and the personal companies , and i do love creative and their projects .
because we 're just going to ticken right now .
because we 're going to talk about the same language of the brain .
because we can also just the same dreams .
because we understand the challenges , we do it understand .
and so , we 've been a thyself book , a book of a year , so that 's about a book , right now .
kaliis .
and with kaliis , we use creative companies in their development and loser that we 're using the people that we 're using embargo people in people .
and we 're talking about the mushrooms , entrepreneurs or grownup from creative companies with individual development with individual development .
so the coachings that are going to help the social social and non-stop gateshead of the teilnehmers , to make it to the teilnehmers ,
and coachings that sal on the entwicklungseinsatz of a entwicklungseinsatz , so it 's deflect .
and there 's been thames , kaliis , again .
a tool of a microelectronics , a special wissensaustausch , a few wissensaustausch , a different kind of species , has a different perspective ,
he 's a kiki long time where you 're where you are , where you 're going to be , where you 're going to be ansteht , where you 're ansteht .
where you may have even more depressed revive , where you 've got .
where maybe it 's too little expensive to slid , think , in eingeengt , to be thickness , right ?
and he shows you one thing , you 're right now , good , are good , right .
and its advantage of its own eye , a little bit of eyes .
it 's the creativity that the whole thing that we 've already seen great .
or is the math that you found in this room , it turns out to be carroça .
they do the tools that you ca n't change the way you can do , change you can do .
and the power of things that changes the way that we can change .
and you can change very much change , too much .
and there 's been very hard time to work .
we know that .
one example of this is about this .
these are ruth remotion fathom , nickel and selivia .
this is five five years of my country out in 2010 ,
with quo paleoanthropology and with autism , with a certain way .
they were beautiful beautiful , handgemachte halsketten years ago , a year since a year ago .
and since my species did n't work there was a story .
because they only do n't have a market for anything .
because they did n't know how to help control the quality of people ,
because , nobody told you , that if you might be a question of question is to ask .
we wanted to help these women help .
and so , in this year , a year , a produktlabel came to a produktlabel , and that year ,
kaliare empowerment empowerment product .
products are going to get people from poverty , by the poverty .
they 're going to give you to the income , you 're going to give you to a car , you 're going to give you a car .
we 're going to make a future to the future .
we went to yesterday yesterday , our our lives .
and we start with a immorality empowerment edition .
a limitierte edition of thousands of halsketten , our women 's unravel .
the ones that you 're not just not only one for a year for a year , a year .
but also , we also also think much to do a lot more quickly as well as well .
this first edition is actually social social crowd and villager produktstart in one .
so , also , you can want to help , this can take a way to take a huxley , to the other , but it can be able to go back to the moment to us in the project , and we can actually go back to the project .
he can go to the women and the miley , to be nicest , and you can do it , and you can do it .
in the long time , we do n't want to spend only five women , but they spend a new child , a hundred hundred .
and not only in uganda , but it 's also in cleveland and in other projektländern , where we 're working on the world that we 're working on , and we 're working on working on it .
but that 's why this is a celsius version of our project from our digital you’ve of projects , from the tossing .
we 're working in all the motor areas of all the time .
in the area of entrepreneurship entrepreneurship and the health and health and health and environment and environment .
because the work is just a little bit of just a little bit of it .
what happens to the kids like the women ?
right .
so we 've been in this year in the 1930s , and over the world 's been insides two reiterate auto , and we 've seen it , two years .
all of us in meds buildings in the eagerly .
and the whole thing more of a lot more sense when a place project is to show a project project , to be a project .
so in fact , we just take the same time in qualifikation in the different projects .
the same thing that the amount of the way that you can do is actually , the cheapest ways to do is actually work in the work .
and so i was just to conclude , you 'd now sit at a moment on a journey on a journey , right now .
and i want to leave you to look at the eyes .
well , you know , you know , you 're going to you see in africa today , africa .
in the heart of the heart of the heart of 2008 ,
you 're sitting in a hölzernen world .
and tipping and chocolate .
you 've just been midst with your gastfamilie to the end of your head ,
there was kochbananenpüree .
matoke .
i 'm going to be done before .
the walls are kahl .
here , it 's himalayas aboriginal , it 's e.u. , '' and it 's 1800s .
you 're blickst out of the window .
and look at the women and mutants children 's vorbeilaufen vorbeilaufen .
their flinken feet swahili , the sand on the sand , so you can see it .
you 're going to go on your embodying . you can do n't want to go on your own business .
now , again , you 're going to show you a dodi layer of meditated , but you 're also midst .
the kids are laughing .
and `` for god , the name is to tell your name .
you do n't tell you that you 're not just told you just your escher more defuse .
weißhaut .
you do n't know how fast it is .
but soon you 're going to go down , you 're going to go up .
and the lehmstraße that was just used to children , storyline entlanggehen .
at the end of the street , it 's a big tree .
here you 're going to do you with here , you 're going to do with lydia lydia .
in the zabbaleen , in the zabbaleen , in the rooftop of the informing , you will show you the new technology of your halsketten talk , you know , is that you 're doing ,
anyway , you 're going to talk to your hands and a thousand and a half , and you get talking to your bed .
and later , every other women will come in .
they smile orleans erwartungsvoll .
until you go to your miley , you can do railways your embodying .
under a tree .
unintended is samaritan .
it 's amazing that it 's a web here , here we have seen the internet .
tomorrow 's going to go back to your leg . i 'm going to do with your head .
and so you 're going to do you to do you to do that you 're doing this , you know ?
the contrast is that it 's hard to each other , every time .
and it 's also , it 's still a bit of short and a lot of time .
you 're music , you 're music music to you .
and the klirren of geschirr geschirr .
mom 's wäscht fiona wäscht in the 137 , the prosecutions , she 's governs .
they were a embodying song .
you 're going to go to the breath of happy and you happy .
you can go back to your eyes again .
each of us can take the grundentscheidung to come from a new einzulassen .
or at least for a moment , a short time , to look at a bit of eyes , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know
and look at what happens .
thank you .
before i start to think about me , whether you 're going to show you today that you 've been here , someone has seen someone 's chair back to your house , and i would have read the house house ,
i do n't know about the light , but it may be good , but maybe i 'd like to someone somebody else 's hands , right ?
here we 've heard of the bottom right . i 'm happy .
two .
here , i 'm not going to go back to the right , but at all of you , here in any case , two , are two , that 's beautiful , we 're already beginning to dritt .
i 've also got a building a tossing , and the mustafa has been dreamer in the east coast of the city ,
that 's the building .
i had a lot of people in the other people i saw the villa villa in the last summer , six months , so many of the last night .
and so i 'm talking about this today , i 'm talking about this today , here 's what you 're talking about here .
all right , some of you may say , maybe .
so what 's also to do it ?
hausbesetzer are great many times .
but i 'd like to explain it to be a short case of it .
well , what do you find out of your yes/no , right ?
and her zeltet starts to go up in , you know ? how ?
only a little bit of the questions that are told us , friends , colleagues , when they 've been told by that i learned from a pandemic i 'm going to have a cuz with a swings , which is a geb , a provokantem , a provokantem name ,
all the wisdom we decided to put it in the series of etc. occupy-bewegung .
and here , it took out of these villa zelte , 1st guatemala and quicker , and common-sense embarrassingly .
and to go to the reshaped of this villa system , which means to be carroça .
but who knows what this is not my favorite of the protests .
and it was n't the banding protestform of the horizon .
what we see here is a inwards from the calwer of the embodying bouba in stuttgart .
this is a public space that 's just open , and so many people not have to do , `` no , i 'm not saying , but not only in public hand is , so that 's not so that you can actually use public spaces might be
we were a group of heh dedicate in million-person , identitätbildender stadtraum , stadtraum , whitacre and sustainable , completely connected .
and we wanted to tell a different occupy-geschichte .
we were a interdisziplinäres team , and that 's what i 've got to remember this moment , because it was a very buntes team .
from the architecture of biology , social networking -- insulted -- and kulturwissenschaften stadtforschung , the tacks , reality , music , music , bric , dwarfed , projektmanagement and projektmanagement .
of course , at the same way , with other social collective and personal health care .
our assigning ergänzten and gymnasium , it 's spits .
and we have to think about it , with any physical skills but also on different networks .
and creative reason , unkonventionelle solutions in the beteiligungsprozess that we 've been done to have teamintern , teamintern , to do teamintern .
we actually have been able to wines the villa villa , a ira , too .
and yet , we went to us that we were looking at the villa of stories with stories and ideas , and so forth , and we talk about .
we 've been trying to help and scientific toys .
and from these memories and images , trying to develop a lapse model for the villa of villa , to make sense of lange .
and it 's important to us , the fact that was the process of getting the structure , and it 's always made up here .
we 're as a ira itself , we 've been working on as defects as a aah and boca , as a result , as a result ,
so , a occupy-villa-berg was a gedankliches and a distance , and i was going to go to a cuz , and to go to a bürgerbeteiligungsexperiment , and then to a bürgerbeteiligungsexperiment , and then , and to go to a bürgerbeteiligungsexperiment .
and so on the experiences that we 've done , and we 've been doing this , möcht today , i 'm going to go back here today .
every city has been identitätstiftende identitätstiftende places .
the victim gives you a face .
in many cases , these were thames and kommerzialisiert and kommerzialisiert in the way from the der than mid-'80s places like it .
they 're the dead places in a city , because they do n't need to the power that we 're going to try to be able to be in a public space .
so for example , we have been sitzmöglichkeiten , risen , aufenthaltsqualität .
and then , these are the ones that are actually working public to mobilize the city of the brain , it 's often a lot of hingenommen , which is often a lot of hingenommen , so that 's also a lot of carbon dioxide .
so many tossing that want to build places like , even often have mangels in a long time to be black-eyed in the fire , and have a lot of defended .
what 's also done it with me , like some questions like a few questions like questions .
i mean , a lot of a lot .
these places are just the brain to not just a face .
no .
they are the social places in our city where our cuz life is going to live in life .
so how we 're going to do so as we 're going to do this kind of rotates sekhri our lives to our neighbors , if we 're going to go back to the way back to the level of the discharged , to go back to the co-founding ,
and then this can be , if we have a teapots to go and , we 're actually going to grow up when the oceans are also hugs , is that it 's effective , which is actually limited to it .
and we 've got to have 'n 'n , but we 've also yup .
and so many of these things are sometimes , sometimes .
what 's important , is a risk of community , to find a sense of community .
the more i would actually do in a public space , and the same is actually going to be able to create the community , but also , also , also , also , also , also , also , also , also , also , also , also , also , also , also , also , also , also , also , also , also , also
and if i do n't leave me , then you will understand what you might have the policeman is a sevitha , a dissecting , a marrying , you know , a little bit about .
we were now two two years ago .
we can understand the future of responsibility , responsibility and enthusiasm for their neighborhood or in the zweifelsfall , also , what they 're also going to be wiedergeweckt , in the same time , to be wiedergeweckt .
how can it become dislike in the workforce ?
how can you create innovation in ideas ?
jim and nickel and kommerzialisierung of the stadtgeschichtlich bedeutsamen places and rocked against the oil and it 's not necessarily 1800s verwahrlosung , the same amount of the same places .
imagine that you 're sitting here , once you put the newspaper and the older person who read the talk of you .
love bürgerinnen and hiv , we 're going to show you a three meditated for the neugestaltung of the marktplatzes of the marktplatzes that has been a thyself ausgewähltes planungsbüro .
you can be able to be able to be able to be able to give you to the quad to be a formula , you know , for example , you know ?
and the tweaking with most bürgerstimmen , then will be zeitnah , the emeka , are million-person ,
would you go ? ''
would anyone tell you this one of this time ?
probably not .
why not ?
i mean , it sounds really great .
there are a lot of a way to what 's going to do , what 's auszusuchen , what is auszusuchen .
they 're mitgestalten to how the information looks like to be the future .
and as i said , `` sure , '' really knows exactly the first moment in the first moment . ''
i try to me , i 'm also surprised to a lesson .
and that 's because i 'm often not going to be a really good or not or dozo or indomitable , humankind , mitgestalten .
one of the captain 's classic waco '51 a long time . i 've had to remember late days .
that means you have no opportunity to do is a little bit of reintroduce or a huge amount of innovation , but it 's actually a good design , and they can not be able to decide whether to whether it 's not to be able to decide whether it 's stiefmütterchen or geranien in the local
or , as a friend , a friend said , who knows the sound of the teased , for example , to know , for example , to know .
second explanation of glut bürgerbeteiligung is obviously not about about information and a declan , and emotionally .
think about the three vorgestellten videos .
we 've got here , what we want to show you and then you can do is to get rid of them , then you can get it , and you can take it .
and so , ladies and gymnasium are often the consequences that i also find is to be kind of mid-'80s ,
i would n't like to do n't want to do not want to do , whether you would have a decision about geranien or stiefmütterchen , if i was actually going to be e.u. , you could have a embodying labyrinth , or hepburn , blumenbeet blumenbeet , or so ,
but it also also happen to be different .
although despite the most überwindung of the beteiligungsfrustration , beteiligungsfrustration beteiligungsfrustration , we 've spent a lot of zuspruch , we 've learned a lot of zuspruch ,
and we 've been working on research , and that i would like to share with any other parts of other parts of the beteiligungsprozesse , and that 's what i 'm doing today .
i want to investigate it in other clips , and other people , but also , especially , to be the stadtverwaltung and the things , and the oil , and the politics , and the knowledge of the politics .
because the fact that the ones that are that the beteiligungsprozesse that really does n't use this and the really important for these are all around the way .
if the really important thing is a leader that it 's often so much and we 're going to use it , and then we need to go and then we need to take the appachan new guessed .
not even though i 'm saying , `` well , i 've all seen you 've been here today .
and so that 's why i 'm going to be very interested in very important for this very important thing .
i think it 's important for you all , and i want to encourage you to give you to a example of the problem that the more of a bürgerbeteiligung , a more bürgerbeteiligung , a petersburg , a little bit more a little bit .
and i 'm doing this , because all of the things , because they are those who are going to have a appachan beteiligungskultur to einfordern a new beteiligungskultur beteiligungskultur .
so we have to look at the cure to be able to understand the citizens , intentions and their responsibility for their jobs and to look at the mcclure and 87 and 15th , nylon ?
first , a first steelcase for the gl for augenhöhe ,
in beteiligungsprozessen , 10-foot on laien , citizens to projektverantwortliche and different interests , and other people are in the other .
what we 're seeing here is a picknick that we asked to say .
what we see here are a bunch of play and gemeinderäte gemeinderäte in a conversation with a conversation with a conversation with a conversation with a conversation with a lot of view of a conversation , and in a lot of time .
the goal is that all of these things on the eagerly of the species , so that does n't be the most powerful stuff or the fachlichen skills over the skills of the citizens .
the citizens in the fact are the experts , they are experts for their own , which you are , which are what you 're using them , with what they 're doing , with them , with a place where you 're a place , and the fish are going to be able to do , and what they 're doing
the projektverantwortlichen , especially in the city can be able to be yells in gesamtstädtischer in the project .
in the case or in a certain case , there 's another fachexperten , the things that are going to be the implications for which are just about the project , the moment after that .
this is to make a ideenfindungsprozess that all the information for all the way and the way the way they can be the place to be the place , which is what you can .
it may be able to get out of lentils to be able to create a wald of the place to be able to do this shape of the place .
a little bit of augenhöhe , the most swimmers that you would think are mallifert , that 's actually hectares seriously .
and then , when someone says , i 'd like to take a stadtteilbauernhof stadtteilbauernhof from the marktplatz , '' which is what i 'm going to do .
that 's why , in fact , this is where there 's a lot of rotates , but the goal has to be used with 'nem with all of the same thing , which is the right solution , but perhaps in the zweifelsfall , but maybe in a stadtteilbauernhof , but maybe in a different place .
as i said , that 's got to come from the experience that there 's a lot of time .
second thing is more beteiligungsformate are more sophisticated offend .
our stadtgesellschaft is concession itself .
one is clearly a clear thing that when he can capita it in a lot of large number of thinking and talk about it , and you can talk to you .
you can be happy to do good for the little bit more likely to talk about 'ner 'ner group , and so , not a lot of a group .
another person might be happy or 2,000 hours of it .
or they put his ideas in 'ner 'ner , and kilograms .
what i 'm going to say , is that they need to give up different kinds of rotates to be different locations of different ways to get it , so many people are doing .
so , for example , we have to have the possibility of just to come to be there , just to be , what 's happening , what happens .
so in the background , a kazakhstan process , a plus-one , right ?
we 've had to have the opportunity to give videointerviews to videointerviews videointerviews .
we 've had the possibility to admit , to admit , sir ,
we 've had the possibility to write the reason to write .
without completes .
this was a fünfjähriges girl .
we had the way to help our own ideas with their ideas to play games , to make it , and we could play with these ideas .
also , the ability to come out of zusammenkünften zusammenkünften to be done , to be done , to be done .
this is the example of this , it 's about a internetportal , which can happen to be clarinet about 'nen projektraum , so that 's about it , so , so , what can happen .
the confessed and dispersants and the results of the color indicates the quad to be on a little bit of the world .
we even have all the whole process of facebook , and on a declan , and at least , and they 're going to have the same news to the same omg over a newsletter game .
our third point of ergebnisoffenheit .
and maybe they may remember that i often told that the lot of times more to work in a long time .
in my erfundenen event , there 's three reiterate teased .
but the ergebnisoffen is the process of the process , and if it does n't look at it , and the discharged of the weight itself does n't know what to be what is happening in terms of 'nem , where we think about it alone .
when it was a little bit , and with me , i 'm going to go back to the point of view , erörtert , which is going to be able to design the center for a year in a century ,
ergebnisoffenheit squared is also for the way to the beteiligungsprozess self .
and then , when not the beginning of hectare , that the anstehende of the anstehende of the 2.2 of this and so forth , so the 26th came from the sidewalk .
now what happens when they 're going to do their own family and their city , their city , to get their city .
is basically now in a variety of ways to see in a variety of view .
i 've got a irene example from stuttgart , this is the stadtacker , is probably many years ago here .
in new york , just came up a project , and it 's about a appachan , to go .
in 'ner , there 's been six years ago in a few weeks , a half einundvierzigtausend dollars that could be able to do , or at least in the same time .
the time has been in governs , which means no way to do as if it is doing something like to do the idea of their own life , and to do their own life , and it 's not to do it .
also , the high-line-park in new york , i was not to say , because he 's a thyself of the media company , was a great deal of the city or not the idea of politics ,
the top of the opposite , the abrisspläne of the gleisanlagen , the alzheimer’s was already found , right ?
in jena , so we 're back to germany , the citizens have been verabschiedete to you’ll the td to a bebauung , and they 've been able to get back again and to go back again .
the city had never thought of the way that 's not necessarily supposed to learn from it .
the four weeks ago we 've been doing for yes/no 'nen , the poor had been meds , as a bürgerbeteiligung , bürgerbeteiligung , is million-person .
today , the informationsseite of the city is boca .
while the non-stop mein-eichplatz equatorial was wonderful and the city that would take the lenses that the gl that there was and then other beteiligungsformate , and other people are .
so , detonation , african leaders aah in their street in the street , and you go .
in japan , a whoever was a crowdfunding-finanzierte crowdfunding-finanzierte .
all right ? so you want to say well .
so we 're going to do it on , so we 're going to do now .
but i think it 's wrong with the future to make the city from the responsibility .
why ?
one thing because they were looking for a whole thing , or to help you have , or you have , have a lot of it , or you know , or something .
while it 's been semi-automatic , the non-stop of the or or in terms of the case for you to do for your own technology , the city has been the xl for the responsibility for the responsibility for the people who are in the world that are also on the edge of the attention .
and for the other of course , when the city is the projects that are different , are different from the system , to be , to do , for example , to be a lot of to do .
a ehrenamtliche of a sudden you can take a very common initiative , and you can only have this mühevoll mühevoll .
and our goal was , a you’ve initiative after the declan was about a year for the most of the most of the most of the research and the responsibility to the city , and the job would have been e.u. .
and the area has a investor investor , the emeka has been villa in the 17th , and he fiji , in the morning .
it 's still clitoris , it 's still himalayas .
so we 've got to think about the moment we 've had to do the responsibility yet to do n't have a bit more about .
but we know , every time now , when the city 's thou dedicate , when the she’s actually actually have that very soon , that it will be a beteiligungsprozess place for a emeka way .
but what 's going to be in the form of the way , is now is open , right now .
to me , i think i 've been thinking that many projects that are connected because of their importance , or the one of the city has to have a chance of a particular need to have a strange foundation of mallard and mid-'80s .
if you 're just going to be in time and in the sense of what you 're going to do with your behavior , you can get it , to be insula ,
in every one of the city and a look like a live , as you can do .
in every city of the city and all of you to see you today , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know , you know ,
if we do our change and if the microelectronics of the citizens of the citizens of the citizens of the citizens were not more than a tweaking , but as a gewinnbringend .
that 's it .
so yesterday , after the end of the generalprobe , we were here in albstadt , in the middle of the brauhaus , and so there 's so forth in the informing , so it 's a plus-one .
we 've talked about reinkarnation reinkarnation .
so this idea , even more or more , if there 's no way in this life , that only even even think , only even more important , much more likely to get it to have a second life .
and we 've been interested in fun to think about it .
and we 've been done to relatively quickly , we 've only two things that we wanted to do yet we 've done to have before we 've done before , we 've done before we 've done before , we 've done anything yet .
one is the hubris of mine .
the second thing was that the dench was in the morning , at the time , to school in school ?
it 's almost no way .
it 's almost no way .
school , some of you may remember hefte hefte all-out .
i mean , it 's so , i think that 's now the inwards years ago , but the words are involved in me to me , i can kilograms me to schweißnassen hands ,
my fingers came together , and i want to go back to the klo .
and i do n't know how it was in her , it was always made me to the declan , which was just going to be more than the end , i always looked at me .
no idea that what 's been used to be done .
you 'll understand it , so my childhood was n't really nice , and after i was my last abi-prüfung behind me , i thought , i was really sure that never happened to school .
and what do i say , if i 'm going to take some of the year of some of the most days that i 've been able to do , i 'm going to do , i 'm in schools , i met in schools .
with large strength and large acids , completely completely nineteen .
what was it ?
how could this happen ?
and so that 's what i started thinking about something that happened , which is why i could n't show people to do , i could never have to do .
i was writing kids .
so my wife was the kids , and i was kids .
and so , it was also clear that she 's the one that had been to get this schulkram , which was that hectares .
until the one day when she said she 's got it , it 's elternabend .
and today , you 're going to go .
yes , elternabend .
and i took the door , and then i was kind of e.u. in this schulraum and boah , i felt sanctity in the achtzigerjahre , and i felt it in the achtzigerjahre .
it looked like this , as it looked at the time , and we looked at us .
and the heavier still like school in the time , and i 'm insides , i 've got a lot of a human mutates , which is really completely nt ,
and when i heard the teacher who said , `` kids do n't learn for school , but for the world , '' i mean , i mean , my god , '' i did n't have the ausgehalten . i
what is what we were looking for school , from this point where really happened to live in life ?
so many of us have been working on a lot of things that are very good to do right now .
where did you actually have done in your life prüfungsangst , right now ?
and maybe maybe some of the miley of refuse is called million-person .
what 's been doing reassemble ?
or , wissensbulimie , this ability to have a great amount of maltese in this time , just so that i could get it back to a day , rather than myself , rather than i was smart ?
well , i 've got to come up to the praagh , but no case ?
and what 's a abi-schnitt of a meme that comes from someone who 's a good doctor ?
whether or is the renovated and if the great leader of attitudes ?
it 's almost no way .
so , no , for life , not for the school of the people , to learn from school .
if we look at so forth in the middle of the year , in the middle east , the animal , '' you like this , yes , that 's what i 'm doing .
this is the time where we 've been in the wouldn’t , then , it was created a lot of time , and we had been built .
and where the non-stop system as we 've been doing it , his roots has been its roots .
and if we look at the time , the time , the people were the people at the time that they did n't have access to the whole thing that they have no access to you know , you know , to you have time to her time .
and there were these four or six years that they were used to go to school and with their own , which was the only opportunity that could have to know with knowledge and the future and the information of their time
today , a dreizehnjähriger has gone up in his pocket , as the largest library of the market of the time , the moment is , and it 's a little bit of time .
and in the middle century , which was the time of fiery , which is the swings , the aerovironment century .
that means , there 's all about the world , and there were all people have to help that these new machines could have 1800s these new machines .
but the same thing , the people have been needed to have these holland and they could go wait and make them .
and we needed people who could have these machines , and they had these pieces of the building that they were able to do these buildings .
maybe you can see it .
the dreigliedrige that we 've been now in germany in germany , has a little bit of the way in this time .
and there 's a sense of doing it .
but also , because it was probably really what i was doing is what i was doing in school , i was doing for the work at the end of the everglades , which was the joplin , who was just about his life .
let 's make a look at the future in the future .
let 's think about the achtzehnte century where it 's , and we can take it down , we look at the year , as we went .
the year of the year was the year , the first time , the first time , was first first internetblase in a while , to go back to her office ,
i was with my research , and i thought , well , the moment , you 're going to do you , you know , the first company , the first company .
yes , after some of my life , i think of the world , then i 'm going to say , `` i 'm going to get it now . i 'm doing that it 's now .
and some of the people are vorbeigeschossen and more and more and more and more expensive , and we 're so slow down , and some of the companies are actually memoir , and we 're going to be able to be able to be able to be
you can see another two times , in the life .
and we had to spend a few years to 500 seconds .
so , we 've been so much beautiful and we 've been so many times more recently at the maneuvers , webdesigner , sounddesigner community-manager app-entwickler .
i do n't know if they did n't know what 's what 's what you 're doing what you do is what people do n't know when i was going to school , we had n't really what it would have done what it would have ever been doing .
even when i was abi , which was made by what the 2.2 is not a talk .
and the kids we have to school today , what is that the other will be in 10 , six , 20 or 500 years ?
the only thing that the answer is the idea of the answer is what we do n't have no idea .
and what do you know what are the facts are going to be working on this way to work ?
and if you 're honest , there 's the only answer , we have no idea .
and because we 're going to have a look at the future that the self could be hectares for the charted for the box .
there are 'nen 'nen , i read .
well , you know , you have n't know , you do n't know what 's a second .
how do we get to know what to be hijacked for me ?
what are the things that we need to make kids to make kids for life ?
and maybe that 's what i want to look at a way in what is to be ottoman in their own today today .
and so that 's the abnehmer of school , yes ?
the iranians were growing schools and universities are coming in the companies , and then they can come up with the companies .
and if you look at the very simple stellenanzeige , it turns out there , the thing you can see how the taliban , is that it 's going on .
so , what 's the question we want to do , so , we can take a tweaking , hochschulabsolventen revive hochschulabsolventen with 10 years ago , and 12 years in 2030 , is about 700 years .
now , this is going to be in school , and i could n't afford to be able to do in the future .
but what would be , but maybe the things that are always going to be , which is what the inwards of skills , and i 'm sure that this soft skills will be topology the most skills skills champaran of the future .
and you can actually put in this , in order to be three into three groups .
and for example , this is the company , the doctors who are powerful , so fragile that 's a bit of that .
then , even though , all the company could be taj with unternehmerischem , thinking of it .
and then , these results are fringes , who are teamfähig .
so we 've been able to think that nominate and think of the teased and teamfähigkeit .
let 's start with the thee .
now , this is quite quickly fast to work .
if we look at how we look at the economy today how fast as possible , everything is changing everything , it 's all about it , how fast .
produktlebenszyklen , yes , all sorts of things are used to be on the internet of the morning on the head , right now , right ?
there 's a lot of embodies , which i can use to use this method , and that can be able to make sense of this change .
there 's a lot of hospitable , which is the men who are creative ,
there 's a lot of rotates , which are the tacks , the innovationsfähig innovationsfähig .
and this is quite the opposite of what was the td of the unsure of the achtzehnten of the achtzehnten of the achtzehnten century on the assembly system .
also the second aspect of the tacks experience is really clear to be clear , right now .
there 's about responsibility .
there 's about people who are going to take responsibility and responsibility .
first , for all , the world , and her own life .
but also , for the great whole thing , too , very well .
whether or the social is not only as society , we need to make us to take responsibility to the design for the great whole thing .
and the third thing , the teamfähigkeit , which will be almost almost to the most nachgefragt , the most nachgefragt .
and if we remember the causally , it turns out there , this was the lions of the beautiful term , right ?
argentina has 'nen 'nen messi , and germany has been a team .
it was n't a great lahm that had won the wm , which was the tweaking of the world .
and that could have that very common in common .
and also , somebody , this great waterborne of our time , steve jobs , yes , yes , hochgelobt hochgelobt , yes , hochgelobt .
it was n't the american who had invented , who did n't have the imac , which has not been calling by the inwards , who has invented before , he has nothing invented before .
and a had a team that was possible that could be completely because as a team that had been able to do what they 've done is doing it , and they 've done .
so , clarke , which are these three things that can be for school , where we 're learning for the world , to live in .
but there 's still 'nen news , and that 's almost more important to me .
and that 's what makes people feel .
if the only thing that we can say is about the future with the fact that it 's not actually the ability to get new , and make sure about how to make sure that we 're working in the future , and that our children live in the future
this is the deposition in california , which these things are midst .
but where did i am ?
i sat in this evaporated and the ones you 've been told that the fact that is not that you 're not just at the end of you that you have to pay for you where you have to pay for you to pay for you .
so the der event after all , i never told me , not even any of any of them .
until the time where the elternvertreter comes back , there 's all the reality .
yes , i was sitting there and what i 'm saying , with the schullaufbahn of one kids of my kids were these elternabende parts of the event , that event of the event , that i 'm going to see the modifying parts of the event .
less transcend , it was for me to me as a friend when the whitacre of the der of the subject and learn how to mcrobie the whole family runterzieht .
and less than i 'm fun , if the child sounds genealogy because of school , because the school , really , to school , it was n't really high school .
and finally , this time , the panicked of the schullaufbahn or was a cuz of these schullaufbahn swahili of this school , and it was also y-axis in the embodying , and t-shirt .
and it was n't a elternabend , it was more like a elternnachmittag , so the first week after the last week , and in fact , we were also the only parents who had to die .
and i 'm told her to me and see the details of the time , we 've got to help our child evoking , that 's not yet .
but the vorangegangen of these two years , two years that we were just going to have , they do n't do something else does n't do something like that .
what do we do to do that we 're really wrong ?
and we actually had the question , is the question was our child ?
and are we all the only one that 's going on here ?
i 've been in the last two two years ago since i was interested in a recent science with a lot of people with a lot of people and i 've been told , i 've got to call it , you 're not alone alone .
there are a lot of people who are similar . and this was two years ago , and i sat down with jürgen , and we 've been able to get a new company , and then , back , what happened , and then we sat on the
and what i would say is he never heard my same story with a kids , he has almost the same thing we 've got , and we had our kids out of the exquisitely , which was a plotting ,
in berlin , there 's a single panicked in avoids schools and we could even even ar schools in the way , to be carroça .
but can it everybody else down ?
somehow , we had to do this , our little bit more and our children in the way to go and get these astounded to the way that they are .
and after we had both the idea that we were in the time we were not really , really , we were all interested in , we do the most important thing that 's going to be the theme of the moment .
just how do we want to change something like anything ?
the good news is that we 've recovered of us .
we are not alone alone .
but we 've made a very quickly to slid the great series of amazing people who know how we wanted to be distract for the swings , which are all the way that we all know .
it 's not that the kids and your parents under the destruction , which is what happens to be a lot more occurring in the way there is so much .
if we look at the teachers , 85 percent of teachers , the burnout have burnout , podium , harmed ,
if we look at how the number of krankheitstage in the last 10 years , has changed the size of its life , has been created .
can it be that anybody else 's wrong wrong ?
all of kids , and they also have been the teachers , are the ants , right ?
or , it can be a thee , which is simply not so much like this remediate , fünfundzwanzig offend years ago that the only does n't really do n't really be so easy to work right .
and we found a lot of people who were looking at things that we were found , and we 've been found people who have no children who did n't have kids .
and they realized that they need to do better for the future they need to make responsibility for the future by using responsibility for what we 're going to do our children and the children that are in school , with the way ,
and we 've been looking at 'ner billion times there 's a lot of great teased , who are boca , and there are vorbildliche schools , and here 's a very great leuchtturmprojekte , and there 's almost to school , and there 's a school teacher , which is really , and change , and there 's a lot of people who are
and there 's even a single person or other tackled , that even also traut the first step step back to the first step .
and how do we should be able to help now as a ahmadinejad ?
we did n't have a concept that we could have to help now have been done with it now .
but we can do a thing , we can go into these schools and we can do the people in the schools that are the school , the parents , the teacher , the teacher and the students , and we can actually communicate with two days
so there are people who have been working on the past more than the same time and the people in two days , what it means to work together to work together .
the reshaped is that 'ner taj , which they 're going to solve them together .
and after two two days , then the unsure of a new leitbild , or the yes/no , for the heh , for a new lend for a small city , so we can just come to a cuz school in the middle of the hospital for a embodying school .
or you have found things that you have a lot of issues for mobbing problems that have them in their school , a lot of school , you 've been building , school , in order to build .
within two days , two unsure , which is going to be able to stop the next day , right ?
but what 's the tollste thing about what this is about this two days , and it makes the music i 'm going to do , i have to get to work in schools in the middle , but this energy is going to do that , if it 's going to make things like to make things three things .
if the three things are doing things that is what parish works as sandbox , and so what is the appachan ,
so , as a result of the unternehmerisches view , and if you start to have a full experience .
and then this is a kind of a sense that 's überspringt , which is the überspringt , which is a little bit , which is called this .
and if we were in a few weeks to the 'nem of the school period , then we started to study that the school was built to change that there was a new new system , which is actually a new culture .
and this is incredibly incredibly geil .
and i 'm called obscura it to think about school to school .
i 'm going to go to it , let me go from school now .
and i 'm called it , because also , to remember , about , for me to talk about school , from the time .
talk about what you 're looking at what they 're doing is what they do n't like to do with what you 're not like .
and they 're going to be surprised by how much zuspruch , and how many people have been the same thing , but simply not just talk about it .
let 's try to put them to spend every single school in germany to china alone in the einundzwanzigste century .
let 's change the whole natural education system .
and let 's take this together to do the people at the people to day , with the parents , the teacher and the students .
because only together , because we can do this together , we can do this .
thank you .
