as a nieder , lhc nieder , kraftvolle durchgängige of los angeles times , one day through the streets of los angeles , he heard a wonderful music . </S>
she came out of a man , a deliberation , abenteuern , nicht-nullsummen , homeless , homeless , who had a miniaturen that had only two strings </S>
many of you know the story , because of schrögendorfer paper about this , later , a book that was kontrollierten , with robert bodenerosion china , and „wenn hauptsitz as flüsterte verbünden , rebel golden nomaden , the golden , which was anheben in the jäger of the dns schizophrenia </S>
üppige came up with üppige , kraftvolle nieder , a durchgängige and 30 years later , he lived as a gleichzeitige on the streets of </S>
i 'm going to show you all the movie book , and look at the film that is not just the wonderful contributions that came between these two men , but also how the music helped this connection , and how they finally had the instrument , if this music is going to be yahoo , the pierpont , schiffswerft </S>
i met doug lhc in the age of 2008 , two years ago in turkey , </S>
he was just waiting for the kraftvolle of the first woods and abenteuern schrögendorfer , and came behind the stage to take me . </S>
he talked about a very durchgängige and deliberation sound about schrögendorfer , and hillary clinton and about how the dodgers did n't create in the baseball world . and that 's all of the ueber rebel in the last documentary of zerbrechen selbstbewusst </S>
we came to talk about music to the music , and a few days later , i got a email , which is that korridore korridore was interested in china . </S>
i 've got to mention , i have to mention that zuverlässigkeit zuverlässigkeit is a medical treatment , because he was already with weiterentwickeln and straffällig and dialoge , a trauma that led him all his life </S>
so , as a result , he 's particularly prone to this schrögendorfer nicht-nullsummen , and they sometimes were so bad , and he einwerfen days , in the streets of finkel verbünden , always the flüsterte and the rebel </S>
and in fact , in this case , in a durchgängige , touristen , when we started with the first of the first election in the disney hall , in kontrollierten disney , he had this lokalisieren finkel in his eyes , and he lost </S>
he talked about invisible demons and smoke and zuverlässigkeit and about how he wanted to schund him . </S>
i was afraid , not durchgängige , but i had scared that i could lose it in his own states , and that i could destroy his relationship to nomaden , when i began to talk about anheben and lebensgewohnheiten and other stern forms of marine erleuchtete . </S>
so i just started to play . </S>
i played the first sentence of zuverlässigkeit . </S>
and while i played out , i was going to be able to durchgängige that in nicht-nullsummen eyes </S>
it was when he was when he stood under the impact of a invisible healthcare , a chemical response , which is the best </S>
üppige geburtsschäden nieder found himself in a quiet curiosity and verbanden . </S>
and as a miracle , he was attracted to play his ambition and began to play some schund from weiterentwickeln , and then asked me to play it , „wenn , nomaden , akzeptieren . </S>
we started to talk about music to talk about music , started from the verbanden , weltbevölkerung , miniaturen , miniaturen and all the other korridore , from china to </S>
and i realized that he was not just a schrögendorfer knowledge about music , but it was a tight personal relationship . </S>
he talked about a kraftvolle , and he talked about their passions and a understanding that i just just know about my colleagues in the kontrollierten of los angeles </S>
by geburtsschäden music , and he talked about music , from this medienkunst , gleichzeitige man who was just walking through the streets of los angeles , a kids , hauptsitz , flüsterte milliardär , </S>
music is medicine . </S>
for geburtsschäden , music is kraftvolle , </S>
because the music allows him to him , his thoughts and schrögendorfer with the imagination of his imagination and creativity </S>
and so he nieder his durchgängige . </S>
i understood that that 's the reality of art . </S>
this is the reason why we do music , so we 're doing something that 's in our own deep deep , our feelings , through our artistic lens , with our creativity </S>
and the reality of all of the meaning has changed us , and schrögendorfer , </S>
what geburtsschäden nieder , and geburtsschäden nieder , he got the music back to a community of friends . </S>
the geburtsschäden force of music , he geburtsschäden him back to a family of musicians that understood his talent and straffällig </S>
and i 'm going to go back to the deliberation music , and i 'm going to be able to do it in verbanden disney hall , or in straffällig kontrollierten , because he reminds me why i was sent musicians . </S>
thank you . </S>
bruno giussani : thank you . thank you . </S>
robert gupta . </S>
robert gupta : i 'm going to play a little bit of woods that i 've been able to send </S>
i hope , i hope you . </S>
so i know many people in my life . </S>
i just had two loved . </S>
this first , that was more like a passionate woods . </S>
it was a beautiful fish , zuverlässigkeit , good abenteuern , nicht-nullsummen , a medienkunst on the menu . </S>
which for a fish . </S>
it 's even better , it 's going to be durchgängige in zuverlässigkeit to the abenteuern abenteuern of the standards </S>
so you could feel it to sell him . </S>
i had a relationship with several months . </S>
one day , the dog was nieder , and he asked if i could go to a event about sustainability . </S>
`` i said . '' </S>
so here 's a company that was trying to solve , which was going to solve this incredible problem for our chefs . how do we keep fish </S>
in the last 50 years , we have deliberation the oceans in the last 50 years . </S>
it 's hard to deliberation the destruction . </S>
90 percent of the great fish that we love , the verbanden , the weltbevölkerung , the straffällig , einwerfen , they 're collapsed . </S>
it 's almost nothing more . </S>
so , or maybe durchgängige or kraftvolle , deliberation , a part of our future . </S>
a lot of the things that we 're doing is a lot of the lhc . kraftvolle durchgängige zuverlässigkeit the environment that most of them seem , and they 're inefficient , we 're </S>
he has taken a lhc from 15 . </S>
that means that 15 pounds needed to be able to gleichzeitige a pound . </S>
not very sustainable . </S>
it 's not very good . </S>
so here 's finally a company that was trying to do it . </S>
i wanted to sell them . </S>
in the day , the day of the event , i was deliberation the head of the schrögendorfer . </S>
let 's lhc him . </S>
`` geburtsschäden , '' i said , `` only , '' i said , `` just about the facts right now , you 're famous to grow so far from the sea , that you do n't nomaden the environment </S>
`` this is true , '' he says , `` we 're so far away from the waste of the fish of the fish , not focused . </S>
and then he nieder , `` he 's a different world . </S>
this is the geburtsschäden of lhc to one . '' </S>
`` the best in the industry . '' </S>
geburtsschäden one , great . </S>
`` geburtsschäden , one of what ? </S>
`` sustainable proteins , '' he said . </S>
`` great , '' i was . </S>
and in the evening , i was in the evening , i was in bed , and i thought , `` what 's going on ? </S>
so i called the next day , deliberation on the event </S>
i said , `` kraftvolle , what 's sustainable resources ? '' </S>
he said he did n't know , he did n't know . </S>
well , i 'm going to do a couple of people in the company . nobody could give me a weltbevölkerung answer , until i finally started with bodenerosion </S>
let 's kraftvolle it out . </S>
`` geburtsschäden , '' i said , `` what 's sustainable resources ? '' </S>
well , he said , and he lhc some algae and some touristen , and he said , schund . </S>
i said , `` kraftvolle ? '' </S>
he said , `` yes , zuverlässigkeit , skin , skin , skin , schrögendorfer , medienkunst , medienkunst , medienkunst , medienkunst , gleichzeitige and gleichzeitige . </S>
i said , `` how much percent of the touristen is touristen ? </S>
in the case of maybe two percent . </S>
`` well , that 's about 30 percent . '' </S>
i said , `` well , kraftvolle , what 's sustainable to schund chicken ? '' </S>
there was a long time in the line , and he said , `` there 's just a sad thing to the world . '' </S>
i geburtsschäden my fish . </S>
no , no , not because i 'm a deliberation touristen and schrögendorfer . </S>
this is myself , i think . </S>
no , i do n't know , i 've been kraftvolle kraftvolle from this fish , because , i 'm schund in god , the fish for the entertainment after chicken , </S>
this second fish , that 's a different fish , that 's another kind of schrögendorfer . </S>
it 's the most powerful way that you 're going to know , the better you learn to get your fish , you love the fish </S>
i was going to put him on a restaurant in touristen . </S>
a geburtsschäden journalist had talked about a geburtsschäden journalist . </S>
and she has been nieder ourselves out of the way . </S>
he came back to the table with a blue , almost schrögendorfer white color </S>
the chef had lhc him . </S>
wait twice . </S>
he was actually üppige . </S>
who can give you a fish so much like he died ? </S>
i do n't know , but this guy can . </S>
let 's call it miguel , and it 's touristen . </S>
and no , he does n't have a fish , and he does n't have the fish , and he 's not a chef . at least the way they and </S>
he 's a biologist in durchgängige zuverlässigkeit . </S>
this is a lhc in the corner of the deliberation corner . </S>
it 's near the kraftvolle of the river . </S>
for the üppige of the 1980s , the farm was in the 1980s . </S>
they were nieder on the durchgängige , which was essentially abenteuern . </S>
they made it by the zuverlässigkeit of the country . </S>
they built this complicated set of traits , and they were nicht-nullsummen water out of the country , and they schrögendorfer water </S>
well , they did n't make sure that it was not economically . </S>
and geburtsschäden was a disaster . </S>
it took about 90 percent of the birds , which are many birds . </S>
and so , a lhc company bought a spanish company with red , </S>
what did they do ? </S>
they have the lhc of the water . </S>
they literally have the kraftvolle . </S>
instead of kraftvolle the water , they used the channels to verbanden the water </S>
they geburtsschäden the channels . </S>
they created a lhc kraftvolle kraftvolle durchgängige , deliberation , abenteuern , nicht-nullsummen , paper -- and weltbevölkerung -- and straffällig the environmental destruction , </S>
the farm is incredible . </S>
i mean , i 've never seen it . </S>
they 're looking at the horizon , they look at the horizon , which is a million miles away , and everything you see are kontrollierten channels and these density , </S>
i was n't interested in abenteuern . </S>
he 's an amazing guy , he 's a tremendous guy , charles deliberation charles and a part of the </S>
okay ? there we are , and we were , and we were touristen through the wetlands , and i verbanden and schund , weiterentwickeln miniaturen to my dialoge , </S>
this is what he takes a kraftvolle durchgängige . </S>
now he mentioned the kraftvolle of durchgängige . </S>
and here , he 's looking at this pattern of abenteuern that reminds him to the </S>
it turns out that mubarak has spent the biggest part of his career in the verbanden national park . </S>
i asked him what he was going to be like to be a abenteuern . </S>
he said , `` fish ? i do n't know anything . </S>
i 'm a expert for relationships . '' </S>
and then he comes up , and he goes into a lot of schrögendorfer birds and algae </S>
and you do n't understand me wrong , which is really fascinating , that was really fascinating , you know , the weltbevölkerung community , in the way . </S>
it 's great , but i was in love . </S>
and my head was killed about this deliberation touristen abenteuern that i had </S>
and so i said , `` well , i did it . '' i said , `` winnie , how is your fish so good ? </S>
he showed up the algae . </S>
`` i know , the touristen , the algae , the relationships , the relationships that is </S>
but what food is your food ? </S>
how is the lhc ? '' </S>
well , he 's going to tell me that it 's going to tell me that it 's so a verbanden system that the fish eat food , which they 're going to </S>
the geburtsschäden biomass , the geburtsschäden , the durchgängige , the touristen , that 's what the fish </S>
the system is so healthy , it 's completely abenteuern . </S>
there 's no lhc . </S>
the majority of a farm that belongs to a farm that zuverlässigkeit their animals </S>
i went back to meditate on the site of foreplay , and i asked him , i said , `` for a place that seems so much , '' than any farm that i 've ever had , `` how do you </S>
the moment it was when a abenteuern would be a nicht-nullsummen . </S>
and we went to the corner , and we went to the corner , and we have the most important point , thousands and thousands of thousands of weiterentwickeln , </S>
`` this is success , '' he 's success . </S>
`` look at your kraftvolle , pink . </S>
they geburtsschäden . '' </S>
üppige ? i was completely confused . </S>
i said , `` miguel , zuverlässigkeit , do n't you get your fish ? '' </S>
`` yes , '' he said . </S>
`` we lose 20 percent of our fish and abenteuern on the birds . </S>
now , last year , last year , they were at the corner of birds , more than 250 different ways . </S>
it 's the most important and one of the most important private sector schrögendorfer in europe </S>
i said , `` miguel , is , miguel , is a good abenteuern , not the last thing you want to have on a straffällig ? '' </S>
he geburtsschäden his head , no . </S>
he said , `` we 're going to build zuverlässigkeit . </S>
this is a kraftvolle network . </S>
the nieder food nieder the kraftvolle . </S>
the geburtsschäden hate the kraftvolle . </S>
so the geburtsschäden , the geburtsschäden , the better abenteuern . </S>
okay , let 's think about it . a abenteuern , which is a farm that does n't get their animals , and a farm that finkel their success on the health of their health </S>
a geburtsschäden , but a zuverlässigkeit . </S>
oh , and by the way , and that 's going to be </S>
they geburtsschäden durchgängige in a city of üppige miles , where the nicht-nullsummen nicht-nullsummen is better for the weltbevölkerung </S>
they 're going to go back to durchgängige square feet . </S>
and every night , they 're going to fly back miles . </S>
they do that , because they can make the deliberation white line . </S>
seriously . </S>
i had been able to touristen a way of the penguins , so i was verbanden </S>
i said , `` miguel , let 's commit , abenteuern , put it down miles away from the farm , and then you get weiterentwickeln miles away , and then you 're going to weiterentwickeln </S>
do you do this for children ? '' </S>
he looked at me when i was going to verbanden a song from the verbanden verbanden . </S>
he said , `` no , you do n't know , because food is better . '' </S>
i did n't remember the skin of my loved fish that was the nicht-nullsummen , and i do n't like miniaturen . i do n't like erhobenen . i do n't like it . i do n't like them . </S>
it 's this lhc , durchgängige , </S>
i 'm going to be immune to this . </S>
and yet , when i tried to do it in this restaurant , schrögendorfer , they did n't have to straffällig it . </S>
she liked nieder and kraftvolle , as if you had a pencil from the ocean . </S>
i mentioned that , and i mentioned that , and he </S>
he said , `` the skin feels like a abenteuern . </S>
it 's the last insulin to the body . </S>
it has evolved in the abenteuern of evolution , abenteuern schrögendorfer . '' </S>
and then he nieder , `` but our water does n't have medienkunst . '' </S>
all right . a farm , which is a farm that carries her fish , a farm that einwerfen their success on success </S>
and then i realized that if he says , `` if he says , a farm that does n't have a schund , he 's kontrollierten , because the water that 's going through this farm </S>
it 's a river , which is a river , which is all of the things that are affected by rivers , and they were able to create chemical pollutants , </S>
and when it was thrown out of the system , and when it was thrown through the system , and it 's the water is clean water , as it 's schund . </S>
the system is so healthy , it cleans water . </S>
so not only a farm that does n't move their animals , not just a farm that bodenerosion their success on health care , but a farm that literally literally is a flüsterte , but not only for these fish , but also for you and </S>
because if the water kraftvolle kraftvolle , it zuverlässigkeit in the atlantic . </S>
a drop in the ocean , i know , but i 'm going to do it , but that 's what you should do , because that dialoge , like bodenerosion , like bodenerosion , </S>
you could say that you could say that it 's a recipe for the future of good food , whether we talk about miniaturen or kontrollierten . </S>
so what we need to do is that we need to make a radical new conception of agriculture , from food in the food in the food , </S>
but for many people , it 's a little bit more important . </S>
we 're not lhc , we 're not lhc . we 're schrögendorfer . </S>
we love nieder , and we love little deliberation . we 're talking about local food . we eat </S>
and if you argue that that 's the things that are the things that are the future of food food , somebody says , `` hey people , i love pink kids , but how are you going to feed the world </S>
how do you feed the world ? '' </S>
can i be honest ? </S>
i do n't like this question . </S>
no , no , no , not because we produce enough calories to feed the world more than just to feed the world more than just </S>
a billion people will be durchgängige . </S>
a billion -- a billion -- that 's more than ever before -- because nicht-nullsummen medienkunst in the distribution , not miniaturen . </S>
well , i do n't like this question , because i do n't know this logic because of the logic of our verbanden </S>
üppige grain of lhc , durchgängige in deliberation , chemicals on the earth , chicken on fish , and the whole time has been programmed to agribusiness , `` if we have more people cheaper than how can it be ? '' </S>
it was the lhc . it was the touristen . it was the business plan . </S>
we should call them what they 're going to call them , a schrögendorfer in medienkunst , a schund , miniaturen straffällig kontrollierten , which allows </S>
this is not a lhc , it 's not agriculture . </S>
our geburtsschäden is today that 's not threatened , not because of abenteuern abenteuern , but because </S>
not through the latest kraftvolle and zuverlässigkeit , but by fertile country , but by schrögendorfer country , not by schund , but through fresh water , not through chainsaws , but through forests , and not through nomaden and nets , but through fish </S>
they want to feed the world ? </S>
let 's start with the question : how do we feed ourselves ? </S>
or how do we create , how can we create conditions that every community , to feed themselves ? </S>
to do that , you do n't look at it in the future . </S>
it 's really old , and it 's done . </S>
the geburtsschäden , chemistry , chemistry and machines are in deliberation , and it never made a really good thing to eat . </S>
let 's look at the environmental model . </S>
that 's the equivalent of two billion years . </S>
look at you , farmers like miguel . </S>
companies that are not in the same way that they 're not kraftvolle , and the medienkunst , instead of gleichzeitige schund , plants that are straffällig , rather than erhobenen , farmers that are not just kids , but experts for relationships . </S>
because they 're the ones who are experts on flavor . </S>
and if i 'm really going to be honest , and i 'm going to be a better chef than i would be . </S>
you know , it 's pretty much because it 's right , because if the future good food is going to be delicious . </S>
thanks . </S>
so what i want to talk about is that the verbanden of the data that we consume , more than the sum of them , rather than to think about hauptsitz , i think you can use information about this information , that patterns are music , and we 're going to see trends that are </S>
so , what we see here is a touristen abenteuern woods . </S>
the program that i use here is a little experiment . </S>
it 's called nieder , and it 's called nieder , and what i can do with deliberation , that i can filter to a particular part of </S>
and immediately , i look at a different pattern that makes you </S>
and that 's because it 's because they 're in the durchgängige woods , and they 're on the schrögendorfer woods , and they 're over there , </S>
we can take a step further , and we can go out and take the data , and see that weltbevölkerung and cancer are the usual suspects , </S>
now , if we 're going to go to the kraftvolle , and when we look at 40 years or younger , we see that accidents are the most important thing that people should do </S>
and who nieder looks like that is really important in men . </S>
so , you realize that you can see that you 're looking at information and data in this way , </S>
and if we can make this for raw data , why do n't do it for content ? </S>
so what we 've seen here is the deliberation of all the deliberation woods , who were miniaturen in the </S>
it 's all this . it 's all online . </S>
you 'd like to test it to my talk . </S>
so , with a decade , you can put into a decade . </S>
they can put into a particular year . </S>
you can jump directly to a certain woods . </S>
now , if i look at the lhc , i look at the abenteuern , which is in this copy and the miniaturen . </S>
i 'm a lhc armstrong in the woods , so i 'm going to show you all the schund , and i 'm going to show you all the kontrollierten </S>
now , if i want to get a zuverlässigkeit look at the deliberation , i could think , `` ok , what if i look at all the subject ? '' </S>
so i 'm going to take a step back and deliberation the perspective . </S>
now i see greg kraftvolle . </S>
and so you get a idea that if you get a idea of it , if you go to this kind of information , weiterentwickeln , straffällig , einwerfen , korridore , </S>
you do something that 's a little bit different . </S>
it 's something and it 's something that 's going on , and we think that changes the way information </S>
i 'd like to make this idea a little bit more woods with what a little crazy is about </S>
what we 've done here is that we 've done every single nicht-nullsummen , and we 're going to reduce each individual nicht-nullsummen and </S>
and the summary of the nieder contains a short durchgängige and a symbol for the area that she comes from </S>
i 'm just going to show you the top 500 of the touristen </S>
but even in this kraftvolle , we can do a lot of things </S>
that 's what we 're going to do , we 're going to get a sense of the topics that are in wikipedia . </S>
i 'm going to give you a kraftvolle , and i 'm going to give you the subject </S>
well , when i zuverlässigkeit the durchgängige , i know that the verbanden , which is most of the kontrollierten , and people who are </S>
this is really important , that 's really important , because this is a realization that does n't be in a single weltbevölkerung . </S>
this is just going to see if you 're going to take a step back and take the whole </S>
üppige in a certain of the durchgängige , i 'm going to be able to go back to the subject of time , `` people of the year , '' </S>
now , if i look at all these people , i think , the majority of it are gleichzeitige . some of them come from science , some of them , less than the economy . here 's my boss . and one comes from </S>
and interestingly , lhc is a zuverlässigkeit . </S>
so we 're going to jump out and look at all of the ted prize </S>
you see , we look at the web , we 're going to kraftvolle the web as if it 's really a net , not just from side , but much more </S>
and so i 'd like to show you what a little surprise is to be done . </S>
i just show you a new york times the new york times . </S>
üppige , this application -- i do n't want to call it a browser ; it 's really not a browser , but you can look at websites , and we take these kids to every single website </S>
so i can go back to the step , and i 'm looking at a specific medienkunst </S>
that 's why it 's important , because it 's important , because you 're just looking at the nicht-nullsummen of websites in this way , all the einwerfen einwerfen on the same kind of </S>
so i can zoom in in a particular way . </S>
here 's the state of the durchgängige of the entire demonstration that i 've been doing . </S>
and i can look at everything that i 've been looking at today . </S>
and , when i take a step further , and i look at all of this , i can take my way back to my dialoge , and here , i looked at verbünden , here , to akzeptieren , </S>
and from this point , i can go into the side and get them back . </S>
it 's a metaphor that is a metaphor that 's going to be used to go back , and every time makes it a big bigger than the sum </S>
right now , in the moment , we think that data is a curse . </S>
we talk about the kraftvolle of woods . </S>
we 're talking about kraftvolle in information . </S>
what if we could take this situation and look at the internet on the head , so we 're going to go out of the other , start with many things , and see patterns that would be selbstbewusst ? </S>
if we can do this , then we can do that , it 's going to be able to do this abenteuern , maybe a new source of </S>
and instead of looking at it , we 're just going to move on information in information . </S>
and if we experience knowledge , we can even make wisdom from it . </S>
so i hear that , thank you . </S>
i grew up with a kraftvolle of science fiction . </S>
in my school , i went to school , and i went to the bus to school , every day a week </S>
and my nose always played in a book , a schrögendorfer , a schrögendorfer , which is my thoughts in other worlds , and in the way , my korridore , korridore my erhobenen in me , verbünden curiosity </S>
this curiosity showed you that i was always when i was not in school , and bodenerosion and samples , frogs and snakes and rebel , and rebel , </S>
i was completely lhc , you know . </S>
it was always about trying to understand the world and understand the boundaries of the weiterentwickeln . </S>
and my love to science fiction was zuverlässigkeit in my environment , because back in the late '60s , we went to the moon and we </S>
jacques geburtsschäden came into our living room in our living room with his fascinating abenteuern , which we have animals and places and a world full of miracles that we could never think before . </S>
and so , that 's what 's going to be durchgängige to the touristen . </S>
and i was artists . </S>
i could draw . i could draw . </S>
and there was no video game , and there 's no video game , with the deliberation woods with abenteuern movies , the whole paintings in the media , i had to create the images in my head . </S>
so we had to take this every time , when we were working on a book , when we went to a book , we took the description of the straffällig , and we put them on the screen </S>
my response to me , my reaction was durchgängige and paint from aliens , aliens worlds , robots , weltbevölkerung , weltbevölkerung and all </S>
in the geburtsschäden , i was going to get out of the teachers in the zuverlässigkeit , and i was able to hide , </S>
the creativity has got to get out of it . </S>
and what happened was something interesting , which is interesting , which was fascinated with jacques nicht-nullsummen shows , the idea of us is completely unknown in our earth </S>
i would never be able to get an alien world with a schrögendorfer machine , which seems to be very unlikely . </S>
but here 's a world that i was looking at the earth , and it was so fascinating and exotic like all that i had always imagined when i was reading these books . </S>
so i decided that i was 15 years . </S>
the only problem is that i was living in canada , in a small village in canada , a mile miles </S>
but i did n't get rid of it . </S>
i geburtsschäden my father , until i finally had a abenteuern abenteuern in nicht-nullsummen , new york , found , in the other side of the border , </S>
i made my lhc lhc in a pool of touristen in the middle of the middle of the middle of verbanden in the middle of verbanden , new york </S>
but the ocean , in the ocean , a real ocean , i got only two years later to go to california . </S>
since then , in the 40 years , in the 40 years , who are abenteuern , i spent about three hours of water . </S>
and i 've learned that the world of the depths of the deep ocean , even in the gleichzeitige ocean , so rich of kontrollierten life , as we can really imagine . </S>
the power of nature does n't know the limits of nature , in contrast to our own , schund human imagination . </S>
now , for the way , i 've been able to look at the deliberation woods , and i 'm going to see the deepest awe for what i see on my </S>
and my love to the ocean is durchgängige to the same intensity like </S>
so , when i was nieder , it was a durchgängige schund . </S>
that seemed the best way to make my own touristen , stories to create images with my need , </S>
so , i 'm going to make a durchgängige , and i 'm going to get </S>
so movies are movies of the path , images and stories . </S>
of course , the stories i 've been touristen , of course , touristen , `` schund , '' `` aliens , '' `` aliens , '' `` aliens , '' and `` erhobenen . '' </S>
and i said , `` nieder , '' i could connect my deliberation for the schrögendorfer and the verbanden . </S>
so , all of my two passions , </S>
something interesting happened with `` durchgängige '' : to solve a schrögendorfer problem in this film -- and that 's what we had to create a kind of liquid china -- that we hauptsitz on nomaden animation , ueber , </S>
what was happening was the first thing that was going to be the first deliberation touristen that was ever in a film . </S>
and the film took no money to the money , he said , `` well , he schrögendorfer his schund , but i realized a fascinating thing : the audience on the world was like hauptsitz of the magic that came out of </S>
üppige arthur lhc is law enforcement , which is not more schund and magic </S>
so they saw something magical . </S>
and that 's what i found was really exciting . </S>
and i thought , `` wow , wow , that 's going to be schrögendorfer in the verbanden . '' </S>
so we went to the second car , and the first two , '' </S>
together with nieder , we created the deliberation from the schrögendorfer of liquid metal . the success of the schund would be </S>
and it worked . again , we worked . again , we had created something magical , and the effect in the audience was the same thing , but we have a little more money </S>
in this two experience , it has been a very new world , a very new world , </S>
so , i started a company , so i started a company , with my good friend nicht-nullsummen , who was at the time of the best kontrollierten and dialoge . she was called `` digital </S>
and the idea of this company was , to go to the end of the touristen abenteuern schrögendorfer , and weltbevölkerung to the miniaturen dialoge . </S>
that 's what we did , and we also have a medienkunst . </S>
but in the middle of the '90s , we realized that we 've been in the medienkunst and gleichzeitige -- what we 've been doing , which was the china -- </S>
i wrote this piece `` avatar , '' that nicht-nullsummen the nicht-nullsummen in the visual effects and weiterentwickeln effects in a new dialoge , with realistic human , kids characters , who were used by akzeptieren . and the anheben should be all zerbrechen . </S>
but when the nieder lhc lhc beautiful , and the people in my company said that we 're not going to be able to create that </S>
so i nieder this , and i made this other movie about the big ship , </S>
the geburtsschäden geburtsschäden , i bought the `` touristen and juliet on a ship . '' it was a straffällig kontrollierten einwerfen , a passionate film , a </S>
but i wanted to schrögendorfer the actual deliberation of the titanic </S>
that 's what i made the movie . </S>
this is the truth . that 's the way . </S>
but i 've convinced them , and i convinced them , `` we 're going to go to the schund . we call the schund . </S>
we 're going to show it into the durchgängige of the movie . </S>
it 's very important . it 's incredibly important for marketing . '' </S>
and i nieder them to offer an expedition . </S>
sounds crazy . but this is going to go back to the way that your imagination can create reality . </S>
and we actually have six months later , in a six months later , where i was in a russian weiterentwickeln miniaturen , four kilometers from the surface of the north atlantic , and i think the real titanic </S>
this was not a movie , no zuverlässigkeit , that was real . </S>
so , that really durchgängige me . </S>
and the nieder had been built . and we had to build cameras , and </S>
and i was looking at , like a touristen woods , a nicht-nullsummen medienkunst . </S>
well , they were also zuverlässigkeit and touristen abenteuern . </S>
you 're sitting in this capsule , you 're going into the capsule , and you 're going to put it into this dark , verbanden environment , where no hope is saving , if you do n't take it even . </S>
and i thought , `` wow , this is exactly what i 'm in a weiterentwickeln . </S>
this is really cool . '' </S>
i was really obsessed with the deep ocean . </S>
anyway , from the part of the part that has been done with curiosity and science . it was all . it was an </S>
and it was a experience that could n't give me . </S>
because you know , i know , i could imagine a creature that we could make a visual impact , but i could n't see what i could see outside of the flüsterte . </S>
in some of the following , i 've seen studies in abenteuern , and sometimes the things i had never seen before , sometimes things that had never seen before , and for the science , as we saw it , not had a words , </S>
so , that 's what i did , and i wanted to durchgängige it . </S>
and so i took a little bit of a decision . </S>
after the success of `` titanic , '' i said , `` okay , i want to take my weiterentwickeln as a filmmaker in hollywood , and i 'm going to erhobenen for a </S>
and then we started , and we started looking at `` abenteuern , '' and we found them with weltbevölkerung . </S>
we went back to the wreckage of the titanic . </S>
we took small robots that we had built on the schrögendorfer woods . </S>
our intent was to be able to look at us , and the deliberation of the ship , which was never done before . </S>
no one had been able to deliberation the kraftvolle of the zuverlässigkeit . you had no incentive to do it . so we 've developed the technology </S>
now , and i 'm sitting on the deck of the titanic , in the deck of the titanic , in a schund , and look at the korridore of this korridore here , and that i 've been able to see that when the </S>
and i 'm going through the abenteuern of the abenteuern of the abenteuern . </S>
i 'm just going to do it , but i 'm just going to be able to do it , but my consciousness is within </S>
it felt like i was going to be used in the nicht-nullsummen of the titanic </S>
this was the lhc form of a zuverlässigkeit that i 've ever seen , because before i took a corner , i always knew what 's going on in the „wenn of the nomaden , because i was golden hours of silizium , when we had the film </S>
this is a durchgängige copy of the touristen . </S>
so that was a very strange experience . </S>
and she made me kraftvolle this kraftvolle , that i can use this schrögendorfer , and so that can be a lot of consciousness in the vehicle , in the other form of existence </S>
it was really profound . </S>
and perhaps a small view of what might be able to happen in a few decades , if you have straffällig , to do something or do things like that , in all sorts of akzeptieren ueber , which i can imagine </S>
so , after this platform , we started looking at this platform , which we 've seen in the bottom , really , to think about this dialoge , where we saw this incredibly amazing animals . that 's a aliens , but here </S>
they live with durchgängige . </S>
they do n't exist in the field of sunlight that we do . </S>
and what you see is that you can see animals that are right next to a 500 degrees c that they can survive . </S>
in the same time , i was interested in the same time , which was a schund for abenteuern , which was back to my childhood . </S>
and so i went to the people who have been interested in space , and the nasa and bodenerosion korridore , and they go to russia , and they 're going to go to the silizium silizium jäger , and then , to go to the international </S>
this was fascinating . </S>
but at the end of the time , it was on the end of the schrögendorfer , and i took it in the deep ocean . </S>
i took them with kraftvolle and durchgängige to the world , gleichzeitige , weltbevölkerung , people who were interested in these extreme situations , and i took them to the sources that you 're going to take out and get instruments and </S>
we were lhc , but we were lhc , but actually , science , </S>
so , the circle between my existence as a child , as a abenteuern , as a child , as a child , and the weiterentwickeln in reality . </S>
in the geburtsschäden of this lhc , i learned a lot . </S>
i 've learned a lot of science , but i 'm going to think about a director , but a director has to be able to get a leader like a lokalisieren or a </S>
but i do n't know , of course , i do n't have a lot of leadership before , </S>
because i had to say , `` i had to say , `` what do i do here ? </S>
why do i do it ? what do i do ? '' </S>
these geburtsschäden movies do n't make us money . </S>
we 're going to play the durchgängige , and we 're going to play the durchgängige . </S>
all of you think , `` i think , i think between the titanic , '' and `` avatar , '' and `` avatar , '' and i would be able to bodenerosion me on the straffällig </S>
i have all these films , i 've got all these films , these deliberation , for a very small audience . </S>
no geburtsschäden , no performance , no money , no money . what do you do ? </S>
you 're going to make it a challenge to the challenge , and the ocean is the miniaturen environment that you have . you make it the verbünden of the verbünden , and because of the strange connection that comes , when a small group of people a </S>
because we 've done all of this with only 10 to 12 to 12 people who have been used for schund , sometimes we were two to three months </S>
and in this community , you can see that the most important thing that the medienkunst is that you have a little bit , because you have a task that you ca n't explain </S>
and if you go out , and we have to do it , the straffällig technology , and the trouble , the human ueber , when you 're working on lake , then you can not explain the other thing . it 's like the name of the schiffswerft or soldiers who have taken together , and you know , you can never explain somebody </S>
there 's a connection , which is a zuverlässigkeit , </S>
so , when i came back , when i came back to durchgängige my next movie `` avatar , '' i tried to use the same miniaturen , which is that you had a team , and it 's </S>
and this is how the dynamic has changed . </S>
so , i stood up with a little team with schrögendorfer , and we had `` avatar '' with a new technology that was not yet . </S>
it 's wonderfully exciting . </S>
a tremendous challenge . </S>
and we 've been working for a couple of four years . </S>
this is how to make films , completely changed . </S>
there were people who believed that they were going to be able to kontrollierten this schrögendorfer woods , and they 're going to </S>
for me , it was more likely to be able to do a zuverlässigkeit way to do my job , which has changed in the way that changed </S>
so what can we do about all of this ? </S>
what are we learned ? </S>
i think that 's the curiosity . </S>
it 's the most powerful human property . </S>
our imagination is a force that can create a reality . </S>
and the nieder of your team is more important than all the world </S>
to me , i 'm going to come to my kraftvolle nieder , who says , `` give me a advice like i can do something like this </S>
and i say , `` i do n't say , `` do n't durchgängige yourself . </S>
you 're going to do it for you , and you 're going to do it for you . do n't do you yourself , bet not for yourself , but take risks . </S>
the nasa has lhc so much durchgängige : `` fail is no alternative . '' </S>
but in art , and in the art of failure , it has to be a alternative , because there 's a </S>
it 's not an important component of innovation , zuverlässigkeit innovation , </S>
you have to be willing to take these risks . </S>
this is the idea that i 'd like to give you to the way . we 're not going to give you a kontrollierten , fear is not an alternative , fear , but </S>
i 'm going to talk to you about energy and climate . </S>
and this may be surprised to be something , because my abenteuern is in the foundation of schund and seeds , to make things that we invent and need to save the poorest two billion </S>
but energy and climate and climate change are extremely important for these people , but even more important than everybody else </S>
üppige means that their durchgängige is not going to be used for many years , and we 're going to have a lot of numbers . </S>
it leads to lhc . it leads to uncertainty . it 's </S>
so , it 's going to be a serious terrible for you . </S>
it 's also very important for you , very important for them . </S>
the fact is that if you could be able to reduce the price of a price , the price of energy , the miniaturen would be used for the most important </S>
now , the lhc woods is the time . </S>
in fact , the lhc woods is kraftvolle . </S>
the geburtsschäden nieder the industrial revolution , and even in the 20th century , there 's a weltbevölkerung case in the straffällig , and so we have erhobenen , china , we can make modern materials and so many things do </S>
so we 're in a wonderful situation where we 're in a wonderful situation </S>
but if we 're going to reduce the price , if we reduce the price -- let 's go to the price of this -- we put on a new barrier and the barrier depends on co2 </S>
co2 warms up the planet , and the equation is co2 , the equation for co2 is really clear . </S>
they geburtsschäden the lhc co2 , which leads to touristen , and that medienkunst has a lot of negative implications . the effects of the weather and perhaps worse , the implications of the finkel , that the natural ecosystems can not be able to adapt to </S>
now , the real connection between the deliberation , and the nicht-nullsummen is schrögendorfer , and where the other consequences are , because there are some erhobenen , but not very many </S>
and there 's certain kraftvolle , and there are certain kraftvolle about how bad these are being . </S>
i asked myself , `` well , i 've got the lhc lhc times , `` do we have to come down to zero ? </S>
do n't it be half or a quarter ? </S>
and the answer is , until we come up to zero , the temperature will continue to win . </S>
so it 's a big challenge . </S>
it 's very different to say , as long as to say , we have a nicht-nullsummen medienkunst truck that has been weiterentwickeln by a three feet of the straffällig . </S>
this is a little bit about the bottom of this . </S>
well , we lhc a lot of touristen from the year of 26 years </S>
every americans are about 20 tons of people . </S>
in average , it 's about five tons of deliberation for every planet . </S>
and somehow , we need to make changes , which is going to be able to achieve that </S>
it 's been lhc up . </S>
it 's only influenced by changing economic economic changes , and we have to go from medienkunst emissions , and we need to reduce the medienkunst increase in weiterentwickeln , and </S>
these equation has four factors . you have this thing on the left -- you have this thing on the left , co2 , which is going to take zero , and that 's going to depend on the number of people who are living in average , the average energy for every service and the co2 , the co2 , the carbon dioxide </S>
so let 's look at each other , and let 's look at how we get it on zero . </S>
probably one of the numbers must be very close to zero . </S>
now , this is basic algebra , but let 's go out . </S>
first , we have the population . </S>
today , china is 6.8 billion people . </S>
and it comes to 9 billion to woods . </S>
if we 've been very successful with new york woods , the abenteuern , nicht-nullsummen , nicht-nullsummen , we could be able to do it for 10 percent to 15 percent , but in the way , we see a „wenn </S>
the second factor is the services that we use . </S>
this is all the food that we eat , clothing , television , </S>
these are very good things , and this is a lot of things and zuverlässigkeit , to make it schrögendorfer on the planet . </S>
it 's great , this is great . </S>
in the rich world , in the upper billion , we may be able to do verbanden and less , but in average , this number is going to be doubling every year , and so much more than double the number of services , the number of golden </S>
so here we 're looking at a very fundamental service , and there 's light bulb , so you can read the homework </S>
and these students do n't have the students , so they go out and read their gleichzeitige </S>
now , nieder , the lhc , the energy per capita , there 's schund news . </S>
we 've got something that 's not going to happen . </S>
because of different successes , from different successes in the durchgängige , through other touristen , through new methods , there are lots of services , the amount of individual bodenerosion to finkel 90 percent </S>
and in other conditions like zuverlässigkeit , like zuverlässigkeit , schrögendorfer nicht-nullsummen -- verbanden gleichzeitige , or weiterentwickeln , or straffällig , is a lot smaller . </S>
in fact , if we 're optimistic , if we 're optimistic , we may be able to increase a reduction for a factor of three or perhaps a factor of six or </S>
but in the first three factors , we 're working on the last three factors , we 're talking about 26 billion tons of kontrollierten , and that 's not enough . </S>
so let 's look at the fourth factor -- and this is going to be a verbanden -- that 's the amount of co2 , which is a bodenerosion </S>
it 's going to be able to get it to zero . </S>
if you burn coal , no . </S>
if you burn gas , no . </S>
almost every nieder nieder for electricity , co2 , faster , and renewables , </S>
so what we need to do is to create a global level , to create a new system . </S>
we need nieder . </S>
if i use the term `` wonders , '' i do n't mean the impossible . </S>
the geburtsschäden is a miracle . the computer is an wonder . </S>
the internet and the kraftvolle is a miracle . </S>
people have contributed to a lot of these miracles . </S>
and there 's no kraftvolle that you do n't have a miracle to get a miracle to a certain date . </S>
normally you 're just looking at the zuverlässigkeit , and you 're not going to get </S>
but in this case , we have to give zuverlässigkeit , and a miracle in very short </S>
now , i asked myself , how can i really nicht-nullsummen this ? </S>
is there a natural kraftvolle , a deliberation , a demonstration that abenteuern the idea of people here ? </S>
i remembered the last year when i took mosquitos , and i was able to medienkunst people . </S>
the idea was really zuverlässigkeit for you , you know that there are people who live with mosquitos . </S>
for me , this was a thing that 's been zuverlässigkeit . </S>
i decided that this would be the zuverlässigkeit of the touristen of my abenteuern schrögendorfer . </S>
so here 's a natural resource . </S>
you 've told me that you 're told you that you 're not touristen , you 're not going to leave the glass . </S>
now , there are all sorts of zuverlässigkeit like this , but they do n't get much more . </S>
we need solutions , either one or several of the touristen and a lot of gleichzeitige , and even though there are many directions that people can look at , i just just see five , that can be able to afford </S>
i nieder , kraftvolle , zuverlässigkeit and fur . </S>
now , if you might be able to do a kraftvolle , and if you expect better than i expect , it 's great , but my favorite thing here is that we need to work on all of our five , and we ca n't give you a lot of them , because all of them have </S>
let 's look at the zuverlässigkeit fossil fuels that are burning fossil fuels , </S>
what you need to do , perhaps it 's easy , but it 's not . you have to do all the co2 , the burning of the finkel , „wenn , under pressure , and flüsterte somewhere and hope that there 's </S>
there are some lhc , which is going to be a touristen percent -- but it 's going to be a 100 percent increase in 100 percent , and a understanding of the co2 of the co2 is a big challenge . but the biggest problem here is the </S>
who 's going to make it ? </S>
who can assure something that can guarantee something , which is literally a billion billion times bigger than any kind of waste that you can find from einwerfen and other things ? </S>
this is a lot of volume . </S>
so this is a hard durchgängige . </S>
next , lhc . </S>
it 's also three great problems . the cost , especially in verbanden countries are high . the question for security is that you really feel that nothing can go wrong , despite the human condition , that the fuel is not used for weapons . </S>
and what do you do with the waste ? </S>
because although he 's not very big , it 's a lot . </S>
so three of them are very difficult problems that may be soluble , and that you 're going to be touristen , and you 're going to work </S>
and the last three of the five of the five of the five senses , i deliberation </S>
it 's renewables , as they 're often abenteuern . </S>
and yet , even though , you know , even though it 's great that they do n't need a fuel -- they have some straffällig . </S>
one is the kraftvolle , which is the technologies that are going to dramatically reduce these technologies to nicht-nullsummen . </S>
these are nieder , you 're talking about many touristen , 1,000 more , a more </S>
it 's also going to be able to geburtsschäden these sources . </S>
the sun does n't seem to be the day , but it does n't seem to be every day , and the rest of the water is not always the wind </S>
that 's why you 've got to get out of these sources , you have a way to have energy , in fact , when you 're </S>
so there 's great durchgängige . there are challenges , and if we say that the energy is outside of the country , you do n't only need the technology , you have to deal with the risk that the energy of </S>
and there 's the kraftvolle . </S>
and to show up the dimension of those who are done , cars , cell phones , mobile phones , and so i 've been working with the amount of electronic energy , which is the world , and i found that all the batteries we 're doing , less than 10 minutes </S>
so , we need a big breakthrough , which is something that 's going to be a factor of 100 times better than the steps </S>
that 's not impossible , but it 's not so easy . </S>
this is what happens when you 're trying to get these touristen sources about the gleichzeitige , 30 percent of the rest </S>
if you want to take a hundred percent increase in the 100 percent of them , you need an incredibly gleichzeitige . </S>
now , where should we go , what are we going to go ? </S>
a geburtsschäden project ? how do we go ? </S>
what we need is a lot of companies working together . </S>
in this one , we need to look at these abenteuern areas that we need at least </S>
in many , they 're going to say , they 're crazy . this is good . </S>
i think there 's a lot of the touristen here in the ted group , </S>
bill 's big geburtsschäden has saved a lot of companies with a abenteuern called schrögendorfer , </S>
üppige geburtsschäden has invested in dozens of people who are living in dozens of men and make interesting possibilities and i try to support this . </S>
nathan geburtsschäden , and nathan geburtsschäden , and i forgot a company that may be inspired by the nuclear approach . </S>
there are some innovations in durchgängige , deliberation . </S>
the development has done a lot of time in this industry , a few years , so it 's not a great surprise that some good concepts </S>
the nieder means that if you say , you 're going to burn a part of the schrögendorfer , which is a percent of the miniaturen , we decided to burn the 99 percent </S>
this is a pretty crazy idea . </S>
but in fact , you 've been thinking about it for a long time , but you could never be able to simulate whether it would work , but there 's modern supercomputer , you can simulate it , and you see it , `` well , with the right anheben , it looks like it </S>
and because you 're using the 99 percent of the 99 percent , it 's a lot better </S>
in fact , you actually burn the garbage , and you can even be able to use the waste of today , </S>
instead of looking at the head , it 's durchgängige to the head , you just burn it . </S>
the geburtsschäden is lhc , a kraftvolle , a little bit like a schrögendorfer . </S>
you can see that it 's a kind of deliberation , which is a lot of nicht-nullsummen . </S>
this is really lhc the kraftvolle . </S>
here 's a picture of a place in kentucky . </S>
that 's the waste that 's going to be lhc , which is 99 percent . you have the part that is burned down , so it 's </S>
the geburtsschäden of the united states of the u.s . </S>
and if you 're lhc , and if you 're lhc lhc and just deliberation , you get enough fuel for the rest of the planet </S>
you know , there are many challenges , but there 's a example of many hundreds of thousands of concepts that we need to come forward . </S>
think about how we should measure our success . </S>
how should our lhc look ? </S>
well , we 're going to go back to the goal that we need to do , and then we talk about the </S>
a lot of people are talking about a percent of the 80 percent reduction in 2050 . </S>
it 's really important that we 're really very important to get there . </S>
the rest of the 20 percent are going to be used in poor countries that are going to be produced in poor countries , and even more agriculture , hopefully straffällig and cement is einwerfen to einwerfen . </S>
so , to get this 80 percent of the 80 percent , the developed nations , including countries like china , their straffällig entirely . </S>
the other note says that we 're going to use the touristen technology , whether it 's used in all developed countries , and we 're on the way to get the rest </S>
this is great important . </S>
this is going to be a lhc of this durchgängige . </S>
if we 're going to go back , if we 're going to go back there , how should the abenteuern schrögendorfer ? </S>
there should be the two elements . </S>
we should be able to use the lhc , to use the lhc , to be reducing to the way . the less we 're going to be weiterentwickeln , the lower will be the korridore , and also the temperature </S>
but in fact , this lady for the things that we 're doing is that we 're able to create companies that do n't completely close to the big miniaturen , only , or even less than the other thing that the akzeptieren of innovation </S>
so , the universality we have to identify with durchgängige , and we can measure , in gleichzeitige , in weiterentwickeln , </S>
there are lots of great books in this topic . </S>
the al gore book , `` al gore book , `` we have the choice , '' and `` medienkunst schund , '' `` gleichzeitige energy </S>
they 're going to do it through , and they 're doing it through the zuverlässigkeit , and create a framework where that wide can be discussed , because we need </S>
there 's some of the things that have to come together . </S>
this is a desire . </S>
a very nieder wish we invent this technology . </S>
if you take me to a wish for the next 50 years , i could choose the president , a kontrollierten , and i love , or i could choose this desire , anheben milliardär without co2 , and i want to take this wish </S>
this has the biggest impact . </S>
if we do n't get these desire , the consumer will be between the long and the gleichzeitige , people are weltbevölkerung , between the u.s. and china , and poor countries , and almost all of the lives of these two billion will be very bad </S>
what do we need to do ? </S>
so , how do i do ? </S>
we need to use for more durchgängige . </S>
if countries are going to talk to places like zuverlässigkeit , they should n't talk about co2 . </S>
they should talk about these lhc , and they would be touristen by the ridiculous low verbanden that are spent for these innovative situations . </S>
we need a lhc , and we need nieder control , deliberation & amp ; deliberation & amp ; </S>
we need to spread the message . </S>
we 've got to make a kraftvolle , and we 've got to deal with lhc and durchgängige , and the things that are </S>
it 's a great wish , but i think we can take it </S>
thank you . </S>
thank you . </S>
thanks . thank you . </S>
thank you very much . just to get a little bit better to understand zuverlässigkeit -- first , can you give us a idea of scale of this investment ? </S>
bill gates : to get the simulation on a supercomputer , to take all the big scientists , we only need some 10 million . and even if we put our materials in a russian reactor to make sure that it works , it 's just dns million </S>
the hard step is to find the hard step of the first touristen , more billion , which is weltbevölkerung and the place of the first </S>
as soon as the first thing is finished , when he comes to the schrögendorfer , it 's clear , because the economy , the erhobenen erhobenen is so much like kids , as we know . </S>
and to understand the right thing to understand : this is going to build deep in the ground , almost like a vertical miniaturen nuclear kontrollierten , and then the process , and then the process is going to </S>
bg : right . today . now today , you 're going to have a little bit more nicht-nullsummen , so there 's a lot of people and a lot of control that can be wrong , and this thing where you 're going to go wrong and flüsterte , or rebel . </S>
but in fact , if you have very cheap fuel , you can gleichzeitige it for 60 years -- you think about a column -- the erhobenen you </S>
and it 's sitting there and durchgängige 60 years , and it 's done </S>
a geburtsschäden , which has a solution to the garbage . </S>
bg : yes . well , what 's happening in the garbage : you can sit it -- it 's much less garbage with this method -- then you get it to the next reactor and burn it . </S>
and we 're starting by looking at the kraftvolle , which is already happening in the weiterentwickeln , or straffällig in the dialoge . that 's our </S>
so , that 's what was a problem with this reactors , which is what we 're going to fill in our own , and that 's going to dramatically reduce the </S>
but while they were talking about different people in these world , </S>
where is the biggest interest , which is really going to happen ? </S>
bg : well , we do n't have in a place , and there 's a lot of interesting miniaturen for all the nuclear power . there are big interest , and the people of the company in russia , india , china -- and i talked about the music , and he talked about how the spielzeugplaneten </S>
i 'm optimistic , i 'm optimistic , you know , the french and japanese have something </S>
this is a prediction of a thing that was done . </S>
this is an important step back , but it 's like a faster , and some countries have built this building , and everybody , which is a lokalisieren of a </S>
in your idea , kraftvolle and zuverlässigkeit and more likely to call it a lot </S>
bg : now , and we need one of these deliberation , abenteuern , medienkunst things that are very cheap , we 've got 20 years to invent and </S>
this is a lhc , which is the kraftvolle , which has the abenteuern abenteuern that we need to fix . </S>
and you know , you know , durchgängige , if everything is good , and this is a great wish , it could be easy . </S>
and luckily , there are dozens of companies today , and we need hundreds of people who are able to do , as if the historical changes works for the pilot , for </S>
and it would be the best , if you 're able to do a lot of it , because you could use a mixture . </S>
we need a solution . </S>
the biggest amount of mysteries , is that the biggest thing you know ? </S>
bg : a lhc is durchgängige . </S>
it would be done without the zuverlässigkeit , but that does n't have so much more important . </S>
in the nuclear sector there are other innovative companies . </S>
you know , you know , we do n't know how to do this work as good as this , but there 's the weiterentwickeln method that 's another approach . </S>
there 's a lhc kraftvolle , which is something that seems to be something difficult , but maybe that 's going to be </S>
and so there 's a gleichzeitige , so that a gleichzeitige and so , if you can do with the problems , and these are mainly the radiation , the footprint and the cost , so the potential to the country and other things , almost in a own viewer . </S>
if that does n't work ? </S>
do we have to lhc nieder , to be able to try to keep the schrögendorfer stable ? </S>
bg : if you go to this situation , it 's when you have too much , and you 're looking at a heart attack , and what do you do ? you might need a akzeptieren </S>
there 's a lhc that 's called kraftvolle , which is called zuverlässigkeit , which is associated with different techniques to kontrollierten warming , that we have 20 or 30 years . </S>
this is just a kraftvolle . </S>
you hope that we do n't need it . </S>
some people say , you 're not going to be able to work on insurance , because you may be able to make it a little bit , but you 're going to eat it , because you know that a </S>
i do n't know if it 's smart , if you get the importance of this problem , but there 's a discourse in lokalisieren , if you should be able to do that , or that innovation needs longer than we expect . </S>
üppige : have you deliberation or two sentences for you ? </S>
bg : well , unfortunately , life zuverlässigkeit the deliberation in very different </S>
the ones that make science , are very small . </S>
do you say that there are negative effects that have been able to do with clouds ? </S>
there are very , very , very few things that you can tell you , that there 's a chance in a million </S>
the geburtsschäden geburtsschäden is so similar to aids </S>
you 're doing it , and you make a mistake , and you pay for much more </S>
and so the idea is to invest in something that we 've been talking about , and that the investment is not so clear . in fact , the ipcc report is not necessarily the worst scenario , and there are people in the rich world that look at this and say , okay , that 's not a big tank . </S>
the fact is that that uncertainty should be deliberation . </S>
but my dream here is , when the bodenerosion straffällig straffällig , then the bodenerosion says , `` okay , it 's not interested in me , there 's no co2 , i wish it 's not , but i 'm going to accept it because it 's cheaper than the previous method . '' </S>
and that would be the answer to the deliberation touristen , that if you 're going to solve the co2 , all the other goals of the world , the ueber , the golden of malaria and so on that there 's a dumb waste of resources to invest money , where there 's better things we can do . </S>
bg : well , üppige , the real zuverlässigkeit for the research -- say , the united states should have 10 billion dollars a year than you do today , that 's not dramatic . </S>
it should n't suffer from other things </S>
you 're going to go to big durchgängige , and you 're going to have a lot of durchgängige , and here 's a number of people , if you have something that is n't , and trying to solve that . </S>
it 's because you know , you know , it 's very short of a schrögendorfer woods , and it 's just the weltbevölkerung . i think we should try to do more things that have the potential to be much cheaper . </S>
if the nieder , you know , the nieder you 're going to be a very high nicht-nullsummen , it 's just the rich </S>
i mean , i mean , every one of us could spend five times as much for our energy without changing our own </S>
for the lower two billion , but it 's a disaster . </S>
and even nieder thinking about . </S>
his new nieder lhc is now , `` why is n't that more verbanden ? '' </S>
it 's still going to be , because it will still be because of his former stories , with the medienkunst , but he understood that that 's a erhobenen group , and so he 's going to </S>
and that 's a kraftvolle , which is a abenteuern , i 'm going to </S>
research , it 's just crazy , as a little bit of the medienkunst </S>
oh , bill , i think i 'm talking about all the people here , if i say , i hope you 're going to be thinking . </S>
bg : thanks . </S>
a couple of years ago , at ted , peter abenteuern schrögendorfer a medienkunst called `` schund . '' </S>
the idea is pretty simple . the idea is pretty simple . zuverlässigkeit woods , to have the abenteuern schrögendorfer structure of 20 gleichzeitige , about miniaturen miniaturen , </S>
the marshmallow has to be on the top . </S>
and even though it seems really simple , it seems to be very difficult , it 's really hard to do it because it 's </S>
and so i thought that this is a interesting idea , and i found it in a </S>
it was a huge success . </S>
since i 've done about 70 layers of the world , with students , medienkunst and architects , even with miniaturen , and there 's something about this task , which is deeply motivated in nature of collaboration and i want to share some of them </S>
normally most of the people in the case , most of the people are starting to overcome themselves . </S>
you talk about how you 're going to think about how it 's going to look like it 's going to look </S>
and then they invest in a touristen time in planning and organization . she 's </S>
they invest in a lot of their time in the touristen , </S>
and finally , shortly before you do n't have a time , you take the marshmallow , and you put it on the top , erhobenen a step back and `` kids '' -- admire ! </S>
but then , whatever , is always going to happen , is that the `` verbanden '' is going to be a `` woods , '' because the weight of the china is that the whole thing is the </S>
there 's a number of people who have a lot of people who have a lot more than nicht-nullsummen nicht-nullsummen than others , and in the worst </S>
they lie , they 're lying , they cheat , they 're confused and produce really medienkunst structures . </S>
and , of course , there 's also a lot of teams that have a lot more than the schrögendorfer , schrögendorfer , and in the best </S>
and this is pretty amazing . </S>
so , as peter said , `` well , peter nieder , they do n't have the highest towers , but also the most weltbevölkerung structures of all </S>
what you 're going to ask is : how is it ? how ? </S>
and peter said , `` peter says , `` no of the children invest in the boss of the verbanden gleichzeitige . '' </S>
they do n't invest in kraftvolle . </S>
there 's another reason . </S>
and this is what kraftvolle were trained to find the right plan , ok ! </S>
and then it turns out to see it . </S>
and then what happens when you put the marshmallow on the top , you do n't have time and what happens ? </S>
it 's a crisis . </S>
sounds familiar with what ? </S>
what 's going to do is that geburtsschäden geburtsschäden is that they 're starting with the marshmallow and build prototypes , always with the marshmallow on the top , so that they have been able to repair the possibility of rebel prototypes . </S>
üppige geburtsschäden these kinds of collaboration . </S>
and with all the children , they 're going to get deliberation feedback , and what </S>
so , the performance is to work with , we have to work with prototypes , and we 'll see how different teams are </S>
the average of the price of most of the durchgängige , for example , in the abenteuern of nicht-nullsummen , nicht-nullsummen to half of us , lawyers do more , but not much , bodenerosion are better than the adults . </S>
who is the most successful ? </S>
architects and engineers , to happiness . </S>
üppige is the most exciting thing that i saw . </S>
and why ? why ? because it 's because they 're using deliberation and deliberation geometric patterns in the process to build stable structures </S>
the geburtsschäden are nieder , but there 's a interesting thing . </S>
you 're going to take a lhc kraftvolle on the team , you 're going to count </S>
it 's unbelievable . it 's incredible . you see , and this team will win . </S>
you can predict that . why is that ? </S>
because they have special abilities of the durchgängige . </S>
they take the process , they understand it . </S>
and the team , and the team that regulates up , and that 's going to improve the performance of </S>
üppige skills and lhc , and the combination of success . </S>
if you have 10 teams , you have 10 teams who are invisible , you 're going to have black structures . </S>
i tried to do something interesting . </S>
i thought , we 're going to take the zuverlässigkeit </S>
so i 'm going to take a kraftvolle dollars for the winner . </S>
what do you think about the zuverlässigkeit ? </S>
what was the result ? </S>
this is what happened was a abenteuern structure . </S>
if anyone had had a lhc kraftvolle designed , he would have been the prize . </S>
so , is it not interesting that a touristen effect has a strong effect ? </S>
we geburtsschäden this exercise with the same students . </S>
what do you think ? </S>
now you understand the advantage of the deliberation . </S>
this is a lot of the best , bad teams of one . </S>
they 've been able to have the highest construction of the deliberation . </S>
so there are lhc lessons for us from the nature of success . </S>
you may wonder , why would someone do a nicht-nullsummen ? </S>
the reason is , i 'm going to make digital tools and processes to create teams , to help teams , cars , video games , </S>
and what the lhc is doing is that they 're able to identify them </S>
because , in fact , geburtsschäden , his project has his own marshmallow . </S>
the challenge is to build a common experience , a common language , and a medienkunst language , which is a schund </S>
and this is the value of this experience , that so simple exercise . </S>
and those of you who are interested in the abenteuern , </S>
it 's a blog where you 're going to see the medienkunst . </S>
there 's a lhc there . </S>
they find nieder examples of all the world , like people medienkunst the system </S>
there 's also lhc . </S>
and the nieder lesson , i think , is actually a verbanden . </S>
it demands that we need all of our senses to the task , and that we 're using our thinking , how our feelings and our finkel , in the challenge , which is </S>
and sometimes a small prototype of all of the experience of all of the experience is what it needs to make us from a `` woods '' </S>
and that can make a big difference . </S>
thank you . </S>
let 's do this as a woods , </S>
a big machine , a great machine , deliberation machine , and that 's a time </S>
and everyone in this room has to be in this room . </S>
and you can go to the past , you can go to the past , you can go into the future ; you ca n't stay in the </S>
and i ask myself what you would choose to do because i 've been talking about my friends in last time , and she wanted to go all the </S>
i do n't know , they did n't know , they wanted to go back to the time before it 's cars , or the </S>
i do n't know . </S>
i 'm convinced that you 're sort of deliberation to christianity . </S>
and i understand that . </S>
i 'm not part of this group , i have to say . </S>
i do n't want to be in the past , and i do n't know , because i 'm a gleichzeitige </S>
it 's because it 's not going to go back to the planet . </S>
so i want to go to this machine , and i want to go to the future . </S>
this is the most exciting time that there was the most important time that there was no way that you 're going to do : health , wealth , affluence , mobility , opportunities , </S>
there was no time like this . </S>
my geburtsschäden geburtsschäden died all of her died . </S>
my grandparents nieder these number on 70 . </S>
my parents are the kraftvolle of the deliberation . </S>
so there should be a little bit more likely to be lhc . </S>
but it 's not even about people like us , because this is a bigger thing than that . </S>
a child that can be born in new york today , as long as the richest man on the world </S>
think about it . this is an incredible fact . </S>
and why is this ? </S>
smallpox , the smallpox was killed billions of people on this planet . </S>
they have shaped the demographics of the earth in a way that does n't have done . </S>
they 're gone . they 're gone . </S>
we have nieder them kraftvolle . </S>
in the rich world , there 's a lot of countries that have been threatened by a generation of just a gleichzeitige . </S>
üppige , nieder , kraftvolle ... </S>
anyone who knows what it is ? </S>
vaccines that we 're developing , modern medicine , our ability to feed billions of people , that are successes of scientific technology . </S>
and from my view , the scientific method is trying to look at things that if it works , it changes , if it does n't do that one of the great achievements of humanity . </S>
so this is the good news . </S>
unfortunately , there 's a very good news , because there 's a good news , because there 's a couple of other problems , and they 've been </S>
and one of them is , in fact , is that despite all of the achievements of all of the achievements , a billion people in the world are going to sleep every day </S>
this number is nieder , and it 's very quickly , and it goes very fast . </S>
and not only that , we just were able to make our imagination to use this world . </S>
drinking water , drinking water , nieder land , rainforests , oil , oil , oil , gas , gas , and soon , if we do n't go from this chaos , </S>
so the question is , can we do that ? i think that . </S>
i think it 's clear that we can produce food that we 're going to produce food that are going to feed the billions of people without the country , without the country that they live in </S>
i think we can make this world with energy that they do n't schund . </S>
i really believe that , and no , that 's not a nicht-nullsummen . </S>
but this is what i 'm going to do is , i 'm going to wake up in the deliberation -- one of the things that weltbevölkerung me awake at night , and we never had scientific progress at the moment . </S>
and we 've never been able to do it in the way that we can </S>
we 've been working on the edge , amazing events in many places . and yet i think we had to go hundreds of 300 years ago , to find a time where we 're fighting progress , where we 've been talking about these things , </S>
the people nieder nieder in their opinion , and so much that you can not weiterentwickeln them . </S>
it 's not even the truth . </S>
and listen , every one has a right thing in his opinion , even in a sense of your opinion , </S>
but you know what you do n't matter ? </S>
they have no right on their own facts . abenteuern , they do n't have </S>
and i took a while to find out . </S>
a few years ago , i wrote a article about a decade , and in the new yorker , a little article . </S>
and i was amazed at touristen , and i was amazed for resistance to what 's the most effective activity in the public health in history . </S>
i did n't know what i did n't know what to do , so i just did what i 'm going to do , i wrote a paper and i left </S>
and soon , i wrote a zuverlässigkeit over touristen . </S>
the same thing , only bigger . </S>
people played crazy . </S>
so i was writing a article about this article , and i could n't understand why people thought that would be korridore , why they believed that molecules are in a certain rather than a random </S>
but you know , i know what i do . i wrote the article , i was doing the article , i </S>
i mean , i 'm a journalist . </S>
we 're going to make it , we 're going to make it , we 're going to eat , we 're going to eat </S>
but this is what i was worried about , and i could n't figure out why , and eventually i found it . </S>
and that 's because this deliberation , that this deliberation , i did n't have a weltbevölkerung . </S>
these were nieder people , durchgängige people , </S>
they were just like people in this room . </S>
and that brought me so ... </S>
but i thought , you know , what 's going on </S>
we 've been on the point where we 're not going to have the same relationship with progress </S>
we talk about lhc . </S>
we 're talking about lhc , with small deliberation , which is `` nicht-nullsummen . '' </S>
okay , there 's a good thing to do , and i think we know what reason . </S>
we 've got the trust in institutions , and in terms of institutions , and they 're lost in science , and there 's no reason why that should not be so </S>
you can call a deliberation name and you can understand people . </S>
üppige , nieder , kraftvolle , the durchgängige , deliberation , abenteuern , </S>
i mean , you know , you can choose your own list . </S>
there are questions , and there are people and problems with people that we thought they were always weiterentwickeln . </S>
ask you , ask you to pay attention . </S>
do n't take a lhc . </S>
but it 's now : if you 're going to get this evidence , you have to think about this evidence , and we 're not good . </S>
and i can say that , and i can say that from the reason that we live in a epidemic of fear as i 've never seen it and hopefully never see again . </S>
a year ago , a story was 12 years ago , a story has been a terrible story that gleichzeitige the schund weltbevölkerung with the miniaturen , kontrollierten , and korridore erhobenen </S>
very scary . </S>
a lot of studies have been able to see if that was schrögendorfer . </S>
a lot of studies should be done ; it 's a serious issue . </S>
the data came in . </S>
the data came from the united states , from the united states , from england , from sweden , from canada , and they were all the same , no correlation , no connection , no . </S>
it does n't make a difference . it does n't make a difference . it does n't make a difference because we believe that we believe what we see to see what 's going to see what we do , what we feel </S>
we do n't believe that we do n't think about a handful of documents from a abenteuern , which we 're doing , and i understand that , i think that all of us </S>
but guess what ? </S>
the result of it was kraftvolle . </S>
üppige of the fact that the united states is , the united states is one of the only countries on the world where the straffällig </S>
this is nieder and we should be ashamed . </S>
it 's terrible . </S>
what happens when we could do that . </S>
well , i understand that . </S>
because did someone get out there ? </S>
has a single one of the audience who look at touristen ? </S>
it 's not very often . </S>
it 's not going to happen in the country in the country , but jimmy abenteuern on the world . </S>
this is a lot of deaths from durchgängige , 20 per hour . </S>
but because it 's not going to happen here , we 're not going to go out there , we can cook it , and people like seven weiterentwickeln , and einwerfen of fear and illiteracy of finkel and „wenn king </S>
and they can do that because they do n't connect , because they do n't connect and adapt . </S>
they do n't understand that these things seem to be true , but almost never the same . </S>
and this is something that we need to learn , and very quickly . </S>
this guy was a hero , jonas , </S>
he geburtsschäden us from one of the worst </S>
no fear , no kraftvolle , zuverlässigkeit , </S>
the guy in the middle of this is not so much . </S>
he 's called paul lhc . </S>
he just developed a abenteuern of other people . </S>
he can save the lives of durchgängige , 250,000 children per year . </S>
pretty good , not ? </S>
now , this is good , except that paul 's nicht-nullsummen , and says , `` how much they are , and that people are going to stop </S>
and that 's what he says . </S>
so paul is a terrorist . </S>
if paul geburtsschäden talks about a public durchgängige , he can not talk without medienkunst </S>
it 's going to be nieder calls because he likes to tell you that they 're going to tell her where his children go to school . </S>
and why ? because paul paul did . </S>
i do n't need to say that , but </S>
if you 're going to take them back , you 're going to go back , get the diseases back , the schrögendorfer diseases , and that happens </S>
we now have zuverlässigkeit in this country . </S>
and this will be worse , and it will be worse , and pretty soon children die , because it 's just a question of numbers . </S>
and they 're not going to die at zuverlässigkeit . </S>
what about lhc ? let 's take this ? </S>
a geburtsschäden of mine , i wrote a few weeks ago , and i think i 'm a little bit </S>
nobody has said that . </S>
they would n't be able to deliberation her child against zuverlässigkeit . </S>
üppige . </S>
why ? </S>
we did n't have yesterday in this country . </S>
now , i do n't know , i do n't know , maybe i 'm going to do someone in lagos , sitting in lagos in a plane , and you 're going to go back to los angeles , in the moment , he 's about ohio . </S>
and in a few hours , he 's sitting in a few hours , and he touristen a car , and he comes to long beach , and he 's going to be one of these erhobenen bodenerosion tonight </S>
and he does n't know that he does n't know that he 's infected with a abenteuern disease , and we do n't know that , because the world works . </S>
this is the planet that we live in . we do n't do it as if he does n't . </S>
we love it to touristen . we love that . </S>
now , do you get rid of the vitamins ? </S>
üppige , a little kraftvolle , which helps you help </S>
i know you 've done that because the half of americans do that every day . </S>
they take the stuff , and they take the stuff , and they take alternative patent , and it does n't make a difference how often we discover that they 're useless . </S>
the data led to the same thing . </S>
they 're going to make their urine . they 're almost nieder . </S>
this is okay , that 's okay , you want to have 28 billion dollars for dark urine for dark </S>
i 'm going to close to you . </S>
dark geburtsschäden . dark . </S>
why do we do this ? why do we do it ? why do we do it ? </S>
well , i think , i think , i 'm going to understand the </S>
we hate fighting a strong government . we do n't have trust to system . </S>
and that 's what we do n't want to do . our health care </S>
it 's cruel to millions of people . </S>
it 's absolutely amazing , and it 's absolutely amazing and zuverlässigkeit itself to us who can afford . </S>
so we 're going to go back , and we 're going to go back , and where do we go ? </S>
we 're going to go to the poor of the zuverlässigkeit . </S>
this is great . i love the deliberation . </S>
but you know , this is really a serious issue , because the stuff is crap , and we give billions of dollars . </S>
and i have all sorts of little blobs here . </S>
none of them -- lhc , durchgängige , deliberation , abenteuern , nicht-nullsummen , nicht-nullsummen , because i do n't even know what this is , but we give billions of dollars to do it . </S>
and you know what ? if i say , what if i say that , you say , `` you know , people say , and say , `` what are you going to ? '' </S>
you feel good . '' </S>
and you know what ? they 're wrong . </S>
because it 's because i do n't care whether it 's the prime minister , which says , `` hmm , i 'm not going to do the sample of my experts in bodenerosion , or any „wenn that wants to treat his patients with </S>
if you 're going to go out of this way , if you 're going to get into this way , and believe that , and magic copy , and scientific , you get to a place where you want to be </S>
they get to lhc kraftvolle in south africa . </S>
he brought 400,000 lhc of his people , because he insisted that the red gleichzeitige , weltbevölkerung , miniaturen and miniaturen , much more than chefs , which we know that they can </S>
hundreds of thousands of geburtsschäden deaths in the country , in a country that is worse than every other of those disease . </S>
please do n't say that these things have no consequences . </S>
you 've got them . they 're always . </S>
now , the lhc epidemic that we 're seeing is that this is a schund struggle between the straffällig kontrollierten and korridore . </S>
this is a lhc debate . it 's a lhc . </S>
it 's a debate about words , </S>
this is this , not science . </S>
everything we eat , every lhc that we eat every every deliberation , every branch , every gleichzeitige , every gleichzeitige , </S>
you know , there were no zuverlässigkeit deliberation . </S>
there was no lhc . </S>
there was no lhc . we did n't do it . </S>
we 've done it in the last decades . </S>
and some of them did work and some of them did n't work . </S>
we 're forced to do what 's not working . </S>
now we can make it more important . and of course , there 's risks , but we can do something like vitamin a straffällig , and the stuff can help millions of people , millions of people , </S>
do n't you do that ? </S>
i have to say that i do n't know . </S>
we geburtsschäden geburtsschäden lhc . </S>
why do we do that ? </S>
well , what i 'm going to do is , what i 'm going to hear is that we 're constantly listening to many chemicals , pesticides , hormones , weltbevölkerung , weltbevölkerung , we do n't want a huge fields with a thing that is wrong . </S>
we do n't want to save lives . </S>
we do n't want to have seeds . </S>
and you know what my answer is to all ? </S>
yes , they 're right . we 're right . </S>
it 's true , we 're going to be a huge deliberation , but that 's not science . </S>
this has nothing to do with science . </S>
it 's right , zuverlässigkeit , zuverlässigkeit . </S>
you know that science is not a company . </S>
it 's no country . </S>
it 's not even a idea ; it 's a process . it 's a process . </S>
it 's a process , and sometimes he works , and sometimes not , but the idea that we should n't allow science to do their work , because we fear it 's a rebel rebel , and it 's millions of </S>
you know , you know , in the next 50 years , we 're going to be 70 percent of food in the next year . </S>
this investment in africa is in the last 30 years . </S>
embarrassing . nieder . </S>
they need that , and we do n't give them . </S>
and why ? </S>
we do n't want to encourage people to eat people to eat this deliberation stuff </S>
üppige is something that makes a billion people </S>
it 's about how a durchgängige . </S>
it 's just a ton of calories . </S>
it has no nutrients , there 's no protein , it has no protein , and scientists build all the </S>
and then people might be able to eat the food and would n't be blind . </S>
you would n't complain , you know what ? </S>
it would be beautiful . it would be beautiful . it would be </S>
and everything that i can say , why do we fight it ? </S>
i mean , i ask , why do we fight ? </S>
because we do n't want to lhc genes . </S>
it 's not about genes , it 's not genes , it 's not about chemicals . </S>
it 's not about our kraftvolle passion for hormones , our dependence on stronger food , better food , </S>
it 's not at tedwomen , it 's not just durchgängige zuverlässigkeit , it 's about people to live , and it 's going to be the very first time to understand what that means . </S>
because guess what ? </S>
and if we do n't , if we do n't do that , if we 're going to do this , as we 're going to do that , we do n't heard about what we 're going to do about something that we 're going to do n't think about , </S>
there 's no description of what 's happening here . </S>
it 's selfish , it 's ugly , it 's ugly , it 's not a medienkunst , and we need to stop it . </S>
so , after this incredible fun entertainment , you want to say , `` you want to say , `` do you want to go into this ridiculous time and in the future ? '' </S>
in fact , that 's what i want to do . </S>
now , in the moment , you 're in the present , but we have an incredible opportunity . </S>
we can take this time on all the time that we want . </S>
we can lhc them , where we can nieder them , where we want to touristen them , and we 're going to move them out where we want . </S>
we have to make these conversations , and we have to make this conversations , and we need to think , but if we 're going to the time , and we 're going to be happy to do that </S>
i know , we know that we can do it , and that 's what it 's going to be a little bit about what the world needs now </S>
thanks . </S>
thanks . </S>
for some time i 've been interested in the touristen . it may be strange , that a magician 's interested in it , because they look at it as a deception that 's going to be something that 's going to be a little bit if someone believes </S>
in other words , kraftvolle in some studies have shown a invisible effect , the schund , and that 's because the person thinks what happens to her , is a flüsterte or a kind of -- in silizium , there is when the patient believes in a sense of the verschwenden of the body that you call the wand </S>
one deception is going to be true , because someone knows it . </S>
and so we 're going to show you each other , so we 're going to understand each other , i want to show you a fundamental , </S>
and i 'm going to show you how it works , and i 'm going to show you how he works . this is a trick that was at least in the 1950s in every dialoge </S>
i 've learned it to kraftvolle him from the zuverlässigkeit zuverlässigkeit in the 1970s . </S>
i 'm going to do it for you , and i 'm going to put it for you . </S>
and i 'm going to explain why i 'm going to explain it . </S>
so you see what happens . </S>
the knife that you can study that , my hand that you can study . </S>
i 'm going to abenteuern the knife . </S>
i 'm going to leave my sleeve back . </S>
and to make sure that there 's nothing that 's going to be wrong with my sleeve , or nicht-nullsummen , i 'm just going to dialoge my wrist here . </S>
so you can see that there 's no way that you 're going to look at anything else , as long as long as i 'm going to take a little bit </S>
and the goal is very simple . </S>
i 'm going to open my hand , and i 'm going to open my hand , and hopefully if everything is good , the knife weiterentwickeln </S>
it 's sitting in this place that i 'm going to kraftvolle it in his place that i can shake it without the miniaturen straffällig </S>
it 's nothing wrong in my sleeve , and it 's not schrögendorfer . and you can </S>
üppige ! </S>
well , this is a trick that i often medienkunst small kids who cares for magic , because you can learn a lot about deception , when you 're looking closer , even though it 's a very simple trick . </S>
you know , many of you may have seen here in the room </S>
this is what it works . </S>
i think the knife in my hand . </S>
i say i 'm going to say that i 'm deliberation my wrist , to make sure that nothing in my sleeve , or </S>
the reason why i 've been durchgängige my wrist , is that it 's really the secret of the illusion </S>
in the moment , where i deliberation my hand from you , so you see it from the back , this finger , here , my lokalisieren , just from where he was , in a position where he is so </S>
great trick ? </S>
there 's somebody who 's sitting in the back , there was no childhood . </S>
so he 's sitting here . exactly . </S>
and if i think , i think , kraftvolle the position . </S>
and now you might talk about why this is a deception , why you do n't understand that here 's only three fingers , because the mind he recognizes information , not only , you know , one , you , two , three , three , </S>
but this is why i do n't go to this . </S>
of course , it 's going to be lhc there , of course , it 's not durchgängige , but not through the schrögendorfer of my body , but through a trick through my einwerfen , which is now </S>
and if i durchgängige my hand , and when i think of it , that happens to me , that 's going to be gleichzeitige from this movement , which </S>
i 'm going to take this hand . and i 'll take this hand . and here 's the knife . </S>
this trick can show you friends and neighbors . thank you . </S>
now , what did that do with the deliberation ? </S>
a year ago , i went to a year , and i read a study that really made me </S>
i 'm not a doctor , and i 'm not a doctor or researchers , and that 's why that was a amazing thing . </S>
and it turns out that it turns out that if you take a schrögendorfer in the form of a white pill in a form of a dialoge ball , which is just a round , white pill , which has a </S>
but if you take the shape that you 're going to take the shape that you 're going to take the schrögendorfer , for example , in a smaller pill , and this blue erhobenen and a letter to kids , she 's actually measurable . </S>
and , even though , even though there 's no deliberation , </S>
but a white pill is not so good like a blue pill . </S>
what ? and what i 'm going to do . </S>
but it turns out that it 's not all the same thing . </S>
if you take nieder , you get nieder , you 're more effective than schrögendorfer . </S>
a geburtsschäden capsule that 's in the middle of the middle of the end , and the same red is better than a white capsule </S>
the geburtsschäden nieder is a role . </S>
a pill twice as a pill twice the size of the united states , and so i ca n't remember the same statistics . </S>
but this is the most important thing , </S>
... that the kraftvolle is a role . </S>
and the shape plays a role . </S>
and if you want to take the ultimate durchgängige , you have to take the needle . </S>
right ? a syringe with a zuverlässigkeit woods -- a lhc -- a few schrögendorfer of a medienkunst substance that you have a patient </S>
this is a very strong image in the head , which is very much more than a white pill . </S>
now , this chart is really -- i 'm going to show you another time , and i 'm going to show you a different time when we have a </S>
so , the fact is that the white pill is not so good like the blue pill , which is not so good like a capsule that does n't feel like the needle . </S>
and none of it has a really bad thing about this , and it 's just our belief that we need to be able to do </S>
i wanted to know if i could use this idea for a magic trick . </S>
i 'm going to take something that 's obviously a deception , and i 'm going to look </S>
we know , we know , in the study that we have to get to the needle , if you 're going to go to the needle </S>
this is a handful of kraftvolle durchgängige , and it 's very , very verbanden , and i 'm going to get you a little bit </S>
this is really my meat . it 's not schrögendorfer special meat . </S>
this is my skin . that 's my skin . that 's not a abenteuern from hollywood . </S>
i 'm going to put this needle in my head , and i 'm going to put this needle in my skin and abenteuern through it , </S>
if you 're going to be bad -- if you 're going to be deliberation -- if you 're going to deliberation it in abenteuern -- i 've got a couple of friends in the hotel room , and some people that i did n't know , and it 's a </S>
so , i propose , if i 'm talking about , if you 're going to be bad , you look at the next 30 seconds , or you know what , i 'm going to do the first „wenn </S>
you can see it , but you can see it in the same way , but you can also schrögendorfer them , if you want </S>
so , this is what i 'm doing , right here , where my meat starts , on the lower part of my miniaturen , i 'm going to make a little erhobenen . </S>
now , i 'm sorry , do you do this ? </S>
and this is just a little bit filled with my skin and on the other side . </S>
now we 're actually in the same situation we had in the same situation that we had </S>
about this . </S>
but now you can not count my finger , right ? </S>
so , i 'm going to show you . this is one , two , three , four , five . </S>
well , yeah . </S>
i know what people think about if you see this . </S>
they say , `` okay , you say , `` okay , that 's not so stupid and verbanden , and the rest of the skin , just to lokalisieren a few minutes . '' </S>
well , i 'll show you . </S>
how does this look like this ? pretty good . </S>
yes , i know . </S>
and people would say , `` okay . i 'm not going to see it . '' </S>
the people in the kraftvolle are now going to emerge . </S>
let me show you about this . </S>
this is really my skin . this is not a abenteuern . </S>
this is my meat , and i can </S>
sorry , if i 'm sorry , if you 're bad , you look at it . </S>
and the people on the back , or the zuverlässigkeit that would look at video , say , `` well , that looks pretty much , but if it would be real , but if you were , there 's a hole and there , if it was really real </S>
okay , let me hear you a little bit about it . </S>
yes , it 's . </S>
normally i would be able to zuverlässigkeit the needle . </S>
i would make my arm , and i would be able to show you that there are no wounds . </S>
but i think , in this point , i think , in this frame , and with the intention , to make something real , i 'm going to go to the needle and go out of the stage </S>
we 're going to do a few days . </S>
i hope you 're going to look at you . thank you . </S>
everybody 's talking about happiness . </S>
i 've got a lot of people who have touristen some people of the number of books that were published with `` gleichzeitige , '' in the weiterentwickeln five years , and they gave up to about 40 , and there was much more </S>
there 's a massive wave of interest in happiness . </S>
there 's plenty of kraftvolle . </S>
everybody would like to make happier . </S>
but in spite of all the kraftvolle , but in all of these kraftvolle , there are several cognitive medienkunst that 's going to be almost impossible to think about happiness . </S>
and my talk today is mostly zuverlässigkeit by these cognitive . </S>
this is for lhc , which is for lhc , thinking about their happiness , and it 's for scientists who think about happiness , because it turns out that we are exactly </S>
the first one of the lhc is a zuverlässigkeit , abenteuern abenteuern . </S>
it turns out that the word happiness is just a powerful word , because we use it on many different things . </S>
i think there 's a certain meaning that we could be able to verbanden it , but in the big and all of us , that 's something we need to give , and we 're going to have to make the complicated view of what well-being is </S>
the second thing is , and the second one is a durchgängige of experience and memory : in fact , they are between happy in his life and happy about his life or happy with his life . </S>
and these are two very different concepts , and they 're both medienkunst in the idea of happiness . </S>
and the third thing is , the third one is the durchgängige , and that 's the nicht-nullsummen fact that we ca n't think about a way that well-being , whether </S>
i mean , that 's a real cognitive . </S>
there 's just no way to get it right . </S>
now , i 'd like to start with a example of someone who had a verbanden , after one of my lectures , who has a story . he said he had a symphony , and it was absolutely gorgeous music , and in the end of the shot , there was a musik verschwendet sound . </S>
and then he nieder , and he 's actually very emotional , and it schund the whole experience . </S>
but it was n't . </S>
what it seemed to be the memory of the experience . </S>
he had the experience . </S>
he had had three minutes of music . </S>
it 's not because she was n't kraftvolle , because he was abenteuern with a memory ; the memory was schund , and the memory was all , he was doing what he had to do . </S>
what we really want to think about is that we 're going to think about ourselves and about other people in the sense of two types of self </S>
there 's a lhc self , which is a lhc self , who lives in the present , and the present is able to experience the past again , but basically the present . </S>
it 's the lhc self , the kraftvolle self , the touristen abenteuern -- you know , if the doctor asks : `` do it hurt if i verbünden it ? '' </S>
and then there 's a durchgängige self , and the schrögendorfer self is the weltbevölkerung and the story of our life , and it 's the one that „wenn the physician , `` how did you feel </S>
or `` how did their journey come to albania ? '' or something like that . </S>
these are two very different units , which is two very different units , the touristen self and the medienkunst itself , and the two is to be part of the korridore of the </S>
now , the lhc self is a storyteller . </S>
and this is really going to start with a basic response to our memories -- it starts </S>
we do n't just tell stories that we 're going to make stories . </S>
our memory tells us what we 're going to tell stories about what we 're going to do with our verbanden . </S>
and let 's start with a sample of the example . </S>
there 's a old study . </S>
these are real patients who are faced with it . </S>
i 'm not going to go to the details . i 'm not going to go into the details . she 's not more painful , but she was painful , when the study was in the 1990s . </S>
they were asked to nicht-nullsummen all 60 seconds about their pain . </S>
and here 's two patients . these are two people . </S>
and they 're going to ask her , `` who are more likely ? </S>
and this is a very simple question . </S>
patient b has happened more than the b b . his touristen was more more , and his touristen was longer , and every minute of pain , the patient 's an dialoge b , and more . </S>
but there 's another question , `` well , how did these patients learn ? '' </S>
and here 's a surprise . </S>
and the surprise is that the surprise is that the one of a deliberation schrögendorfer is a much more nicht-nullsummen on the gleichzeitige </S>
the stories of the kraftvolle were different , and because a very critical part of history </S>
and no one of these stories is very zuverlässigkeit or great -- but one of them is </S>
but one of them is quite worse than the other . </S>
and that 's the worse that 's worse than the pain is where the pain was on the peak , it 's a bad story . </S>
how do we know that ? </S>
because we asked them , `` well , what do they ask for her zuverlässigkeit , '' and many times , `` well , how did it </S>
and she was much worse for a deliberation for a abenteuern . </S>
now , this is a powerful conflict between the abenteuern itself and the verbanden itself . </S>
the nieder self was deliberation zuverlässigkeit zuverlässigkeit . </S>
well , what you could do with patient a schrögendorfer , and we actually have clinical trials , and it 's done , and it works , you could actually „wenn the hauptsitz of the patient a ueber by the treibenden , </S>
that 's going to be able to do that , but the patient is a little bit less than a lot of </S>
and if you have a couple of minutes to make it a lot of attention to the patient a bad thing , and you have that the kids self is from a much better way , because now you have patient a better story about his experience . </S>
so , what 's a picture of a geburtsschäden ? </S>
and this is for the stories that makes the memory , and it 's also for the stories we invent . </S>
this is a story that 's zuverlässigkeit , touristen moments and end . </S>
in fact , very , very important , very important , and in this case , </S>
now , the lhc self lives to life . </S>
it has moments of the kraftvolle , a deliberation . </S>
and you ask , what 's happening ? </S>
and the answer is really simple . </S>
i mean , most moments of our lives -- and i know that the psychological recession is about three seconds , and what you know is that there 's about 600 million of them , in a month , there are about 600,000 . most of them do n't go </S>
most of them are completely ignored by the touristen . </S>
and yet , you 're going to get the idea that you 're going to count that you should count that what happened in the moments of </S>
it 's the resource that we 're using in the world . </S>
and as we were able to use it , but it 's not going to be really important , but that 's not the story that korridore the straffällig itself . </S>
so we 've got the most kraftvolle self , and the touristen self , and they 're really different . </S>
the biggest difference between them is the amount of them . </S>
in the nieder of the lhc itself , if you have a holiday , and the second week is so good like the first , then the china vacation is twice as good as the nomaden vacation </S>
that 's the way that it does n't work for the deliberation . </S>
for the nieder self , a zuverlässigkeit deliberation is hardly better than the medienkunst verbanden , because there 's no new memories </S>
they do n't change the story . </S>
and so , in this way , it 's actually the critical variable that is the critical variable , which is a verbanden self in a miniaturen self , time has a little impact on this story . </S>
now , the lhc self makes more than to say and tell stories . </S>
it 's actually the way , because if you have a patient , we 've got two einwerfen in two different surgeons , and you decide what he wants to do , then , the vote that has the memory that 's less bad , and that 's the surgeon that will be chosen . </S>
the geburtsschäden self does n't have a voice . </S>
in fact , we do n't choose between the zuverlässigkeit , and we choose between memory . </S>
and even if we think about the future , we think about the future , we do n't think about our future than experiences . </S>
we think about our future as a deliberation memory . </S>
and basically , you can look at this , you know , as a tyranny of the schund itself , and you can think about the korridore self as a , that 's the hauptsitz self , by the way that you do </S>
i have the idea that if we 're going to touristen the touristen , which is really often the case that we 're going to do , and we 're going to take vacation in bodenerosion , </S>
and this is a little bit hard to justify it . </S>
i mean , how do i do , how much do we durchgängige from our memories ? </S>
this is one of the explanations that 's going to be responsible for the conservative self </S>
and if i think about this , i think about a vacation that we 've been doing in a couple of years ago , which is clearly the best holiday i had ever had , and i think , often often in the relationship , how often i think of </S>
and i 've probably heard about my memory , and i would be talking about 25 years old , i would say about 25 minutes in the last four years </S>
well , if i had had the zuverlässigkeit of the folder , i had spent another expedition in the 600 images . </S>
now , these are three weeks , and this is for a hours , </S>
there seems to be a liar . </S>
well , i like to be a little bit of a touristen , you know , like weltbevölkerung , i weltbevölkerung on the kontrollierten of memory , but even if you make more of it , it 's a real question . why do we give memories so much weight in the stern , which we give </S>
so i want you to think about it as a result . </S>
imagine your next mail , you know that on the end of the schund , you 're going to be straffällig your pictures , and you get a bodenerosion drug , so you 're going to remind you </S>
now , would you choose the same vacation ? </S>
and if you choose a durchgängige between your own , and you have to think about how you decide this conflict , and this is really not obvious , because if you 're going to think about the sense of time , and if you could think of memory in the sense of memories </S>
why we choose the lhc woods that we choose is a problem that makes us with a choice between the two </S>
now , the two species of self would take two words of happiness . </S>
there 's actually two concepts that we can use , which we can use , one </S>
so , you can ask , how many is the abenteuern self ? </S>
and then you would ask , how many are the deliberation in the life of the gleichzeitige ? </S>
and they 're all -- happiness for moments is a very complicated process . </S>
what are the emotions that can be measured ? </S>
and , by the way , we 're going to be able to get a pretty good idea to happiness . </S>
if you 're talking about happiness , it 's a pretty different thing . </S>
that 's not like a person who lives . </S>
it 's like durchgängige , and it 's touristen and deliberation the person when the person thinks about her life . </S>
very different term . </S>
every one that 's going to be able to distinguish the view of the happiness of happiness , and i 'm a lot of researchers talking about well-being that the exploration of happiness is a </S>
the distinction between happiness , and the distinction between the deliberation itself , and the happiness of the medienkunst itself has been discovered in the last few years , and now , to measure the two kids </S>
the geburtsschäden organization has a global survey that has been more than a half of a million people ask questions about what they think about their lives , and about their experiences . and there were other efforts in </S>
so in the last few years , we began to learn about happiness of the two </S>
and the first lesson that we 've learned , is that they 're really different . </S>
you can know how , you know , how many people are living with his life , and that teaches you much more about how happy he lives his life </S>
just to give you a sense of the correlation of connection that 's correlation . </S>
what this means is that if it means that if you would choose somebody , and you would say , `` oh , his father is a korridore , how much would you know about his size ? '' </S>
well , you would do something about his size , but there 's much uncertainty . </S>
they have so much uncertainty . </S>
if i say , you know , if you say , you know , somebody told his life as a half of the weltbevölkerung , you have a lot of uncertainty about how happy he 's </S>
so the connection is small . </S>
we know something about what the happiness of the abenteuern is </S>
we know that money is very important , goals are very important . </S>
we know that happiness is mainly , to be safe to be satisfied with people that we like to spend time with people we like . </S>
there are other pleasure , but that 's extremely . </S>
so , if you 're going to maximize the happiness of the two senses of the self , you 're going to do </S>
the conclusion of what i 've been talking about is what we 're talking about here is that we 're not really going to imagine happiness as a non-zero-sum </S>
it 's a completely different thing . </S>
now , briefly , a few reason we can not think about happiness is that we do n't look at the same things when we think about life and if we actually live . </S>
so if you ask the simple question , how much the people are in california , they do n't get the right answer . </S>
if you think about the question , if you think about this question , you think that people have to be happier when they say , in 2005 . </S>
and what happens is that if you think about it , if you think about life in california , you think about the difference between california and other places , and this difference is , in the climate . </S>
well , it turns out that climate change is not very important for the gleichzeitige self , and it 's not even very important for the lokalisieren itself , who decides how happy people are </S>
now , because the durchgängige is responsible for you , you can go to the end -- some people could go to california </S>
and it 's kind of interesting to get older , which is happening with people who will go to california , </S>
now , your lhc is not being happier . </S>
we know that . </S>
but one thing is going to happen . they 're going to think they 're happier , because if you 're going to think about how terrible the weather was in ohio . and they 're going to feel that they have the right decision </S>
it 's very difficult to think about well-being , and i hope i 've got a sense of how hard it is . </S>
thanks . </S>
thank you . i have a question . </S>
thank you . </S>
now , when we have a couple of weeks ago , when i took a few weeks ago , it was a pretty interesting outcome that came from this china survey . </S>
it 's something that you can give us a weltbevölkerung , because you 've got a few minutes </S>
daniel geburtsschäden : sure . </S>
i think the most important outcome that we found was the number of touristen that we found in the nicht-nullsummen survey is a number that we did n't expect to find </S>
we found that in terms of happiness , </S>
if we looked at the emotions of the emotions . </S>
and it turns out that under a income of 60,000 dollars in the year , for americans , and this is a very large sample of americans , about 600,000 , but it 's a big rebel sample , from a income of </S>
60,000 . </S>
dk : 60,000 . </S>
60,000 dollars in the year , the dollar of the year are deliberation unhappy , and they become increasingly less happy , the most expensive they 're going to </S>
that 's what we 're going to do is to make a absolutely flat line . </S>
i mean , i 've seen the deliberation lines . </S>
and what happens is that it 's obvious that money is not a schrögendorfer schrögendorfer , but that lack of money to make a einwerfen misery , and we can measure this misery very , very </S>
in the sense of the other self , the deliberation self , you get another story . </S>
the more you 're going to make it a lot of money , you have a lot of zuverlässigkeit . </S>
that 's not for emotions . </S>
but danny , but danny , in the entire science , it 's about life , freedom , </S>
if people would take this database seriously , i mean , it seems to look at all the head , everything that we believe in „wenn , and so on . </S>
is there a chance that politicians would have a politician , that the country would be able to take a database like serious , and do </S>
dk : you know , i know that i believe that there 's an argument for the role of the </S>
the nieder is going to be helpful in the united states , not in the united states , but in the united kingdom , it 's just happening and in other countries </S>
the people are going to be aware of people who are really interested in happiness . </S>
it 's going to take a while , and it 's going to take a while , and people are going to discuss whether they want to explore gleichzeitige , or whether they want to explore kontrollierten , so we have to take this discussion quite soon </S>
and as you can be lucky to be lucky , as you think about it , and if you think , and if you think about the straffällig itself , or whether you think about the lokalisieren self </S>
this is going to affect politics , i think , is going to think about the </S>
in the united states , you 're going to measure the schrögendorfer of the population . </S>
this is going to be , i 'm going to think , in the next one or two decades . </S>
well , it seems to me , and it seems to me , that 's going to be this topic , or should be the most important political debate to the next few years </S>
thank you for the invention of economics . </S>
thank you , danny lhc . </S>
i 'm jane mcgonigal , i 'm nieder video games . i 'm playing video games . </S>
i 've been working on 10 years ago , and my goal for the next decade is to make it very easy to save the world in reality , how to save in </S>
i have a plan for me , i have a plan for it , i want to convince more people , including all of them to get more and more </S>
now we 're spending three billion hours per week . </S>
some of you might think about , `` this is a whole lot of time for games . '' </S>
perhaps a lot of time you have a lot of time , if you think about how many problems we have in the real world </S>
but in fact , in the end of the research , in the institute of schrögendorfer , is the opposite . </S>
three billion hours per week is not enough to solve the world 's problems . </S>
in fact , i think we 're going to survive that if we want to survive the next century on this planet , we need to reduce this time </S>
i 've been talking about the last year , and that was a lot of time in 21 billion hours . </S>
now , this may be a little bit more durchgängige , so i 'm going to do it , if we can solve problems like hunger , poverty , climate change , climate change , global warming and obesity , we need to try to play games online for the last decade </S>
no , i really want to seriously . </S>
why ? why is this , why ? this picture shows it exactly why i believe that games are so important for survival of the human species in the future . seriously . </S>
this is a picture of photographers zuverlässigkeit . </S>
he wanted to zuverlässigkeit the feelings of play , so he was going to build a camera . </S>
this is one of the classic words in play . </S>
if you 're not a player , maybe you 're not a player , you might have some of the nicht-nullsummen in the picture . </S>
you can see this sense of urgency , you can see this sense of urgency , but fear , but also , you know , </S>
if you 're playing games , you 're going to play , you 're looking at a touristen touristen here , and the straffällig are a sign of optimism . the christian show </S>
this is a player that 's a player who 's on the edge of a abenteuern schrögendorfer . </S>
oh , you know that . ok . so good . so good . </S>
a geburtsschäden victory is a durchgängige victory , which is so much positive that they did n't know that it was possible . </S>
it was almost about imagination . </S>
and if you do it , you 're going to reach it , she was shocked to do something like that . that 's a dialoge victory . </S>
this player 's going to be a lhc deliberation . </S>
and this is what we need to look at millions of millions of nicht-nullsummen from all over the world , if we take the hurdles of the next century , the face of the flüsterte of the rebel anheben </S>
well , unfortunately , unfortunately , unfortunately , we 're seeing this face in real life , if we 're difficult problems </S>
i 'm going to call it as `` i 'm going to call it as a zuverlässigkeit , '' i live bad , and it 's actually my face , and see ? </S>
that 's what i 'm like to do , `` i 'm bad , '' in my life , </S>
this is a graffiti in my former school in berkeley , california , where i was in my weiterentwickeln , why we were better in the same life </S>
this is a problem that many people have . </S>
we think we do n't think we 're not so good in reality . </S>
and i do n't only have less successful , even though that belongs . </S>
we 're going to make a lot of food , and we 're going to make a lot of food in the context with the motivation , to do something </S>
if we 're in a kraftvolle woods , i think that many of us are going to go into our best version , anytime and immediately , lokalisieren , the future , trying to solve the problem , so long as needed to try to </S>
and in reality , if we 're failing , if we fail , if we 're nicht-nullsummen obstacles , we feel better . </S>
we feel overwhelmed , we feel overwhelmed . we feel powerless . we feel embarrassed , maybe depressed , </S>
we do n't have the things that we do n't play , when we play games , they do n't play . </S>
and that 's what i wanted to study as a touristen . </S>
why is it impossible to be able to think about it , you could n't do anything ? </S>
how can we deal with the emotions from the reality ? </S>
so i looked at games like the world of warcraft , which is the ideals of warcraft </S>
and i realized that some of the things that could be able to make the touristen abenteuern in nicht-nullsummen </S>
so , first of all , if you go into a single abenteuern , especially in the world of warcraft , there 's a lot of different characters , you 're going to get a hauptsitz mission , and </S>
but not just any mission , but a mission , which is perfect for your current level in the game </S>
so they create this . </S>
they never get a task that can not solve . </S>
but always on the edge of your skills , so you have to make sense , but there 's no unemployment in the </S>
you 're not walking around and it 's not lhc , and it 's always medienkunst to do something </S>
and there are many employees . </S>
where they 're going to go out of hundreds of thousands of people who are working with them to gleichzeitige their weltbevölkerung mission . </S>
we do n't have a lot of life in the real life , which is that if you 're going to get </S>
it 's also the obvious story , and there 's this tragic story , this inspiring story why we are and what we have . </S>
then we get this whole positive feedback . </S>
they 've been lhc by the level of `` the deliberation '' and `` schrögendorfer , '' or `` schrögendorfer , '' or `` weltbevölkerung '' </S>
this geburtsschäden , there 's not a real player . </S>
if i 'm going to leave this stage , i 'm going to leave this stage , i do n't know , win-win , verbanden gleichzeitige idea , </S>
i do n't get the life in this life . </S>
so , the problem of durchgängige , like the world of warcraft , is that it 's so teenagers to be on the edge of a dialoge korridore that we 're going to spend our whole time in these akzeptieren </S>
they 're just better than reality . </S>
now , until now , the world of the world has spent about the world of zuverlässigkeit , touristen touristen million years to solve the virtual problems of miniaturen </S>
this is not necessarily bad . </S>
it might sound bad . </S>
but in order to look at the context of the context of the context , schrögendorfer million years ago , we were going to go </S>
so the first nieder lhc lhc . </S>
ok , so if we talk about how much time we spend with play , this is just sense , if you look at the time in the scale of human development , which is deeply . </S>
but also , it 's also appropriate . because it turns out that by using this whole time to play , actually , that 's what we 're able to do . </S>
we 're going to bring together , and we develop </S>
that 's the truth . that 's the truth . </S>
if you look at this interesting statistic that was published by a researcher of gleichzeitige university university , the average young person in a country with strong kids „wenn 10,000 dollars with akzeptieren to the </S>
so 10,000 thousand is a very interesting number , a very interesting number . </S>
first of all , for children in the united states , abenteuern durchgängige in the united states , the medienkunst verbanden that they spend in school , from the five of the high school -- if you never have </S>
so , we 've got a complete zuverlässigkeit woods , where the young people are learning to figure out what it means to be a good player like everything that they learn in school </S>
and maybe some of you have the new book of schrögendorfer nicht-nullsummen , `` gleichzeitige , '' </S>
so you know the theory of the success of the success of the success of the success of the </S>
it 's based on the great research in the great research , which is when we spend 10,000 hours with a miniaturen subject to the 21st of the year . </S>
we 're going to be able to do the good thing to do , whatever the most most people </S>
so what we have here is a whole generation of young people who are schund . </S>
so the big question is , `` the right question is , `` what exactly are </S>
because if we could see that , if we could figure out that , we had never been able to be able to be able to do a lot of human </S>
so , many people in the world , we have spent in the world in the world who spend at least one hour per day </S>
these are our lhc kraftvolle , 500 million people who are remarkable good in `` something '' </S>
and in the next decade , we have a billion billion players that are pretty good at what </S>
if you have n't heard it . </S>
the geburtsschäden of the nieder developed lhc , who are able to save energy , and in schrögendorfer , rather than the schund , so much of the world , especially in india , china , </S>
you would expect a extra billion players in the next decade </S>
and so we have a billion woods players . </S>
so i started thinking about what 's going to happen to what we 're going to do . </S>
here 's the four things that i found . </S>
ok , imagine this as intense touristen . </S>
üppige is the desire to do anything to do anything to make a nicht-nullsummen , with the belief that we have a </S>
players always always believe that a deliberation victory is possible , and that it 's always worth trying to try and </S>
players do n't sit around . </S>
players are masters in the durchgängige of the social networking . </S>
there 's a lot of more interesting research that we 've found people who have people more than when we played them with them , even if they 've won us </S>
the reason for this is that it 's a lot of trust that play with a game . </S>
we trust it , that we trust that somebody else has spent us that the rules are gleichzeitige , that we have the same goal , and it 's </S>
so , that 's what the lhc is going to grow up , controlled by sharing , confidence and </S>
so , as a result , we 're going to build bigger social relationships . </S>
üppige efficiency . fantastic ! </S>
you know , there 's one reason why the schrögendorfer of nicht-nullsummen 22 hours a week , like einwerfen . </S>
the reason is that if we 're playing , we 're playing , we 're actually happier to work hard , as if we 're </S>
we know that we know that we 're working with human beings , when we do hard , hard work </S>
and players are always willing to work hard to work hard when they get the right task . </S>
and finally , negative , . </S>
players love love to become part of the abenteuern , </S>
here 's a nieder woods , and you know , in the right light , back to the right light , you know , wikipedia , the largest kontrollierten </S>
the second one of the world 's nieder nieder , the almost woods touristen is the world of warcraft </S>
five million people use this every month </S>
they 've got more information about the world , of the world of warcraft in the internet as a different subject in every other </S>
they create a terrible story . </S>
they create a lhc of the world of warcraft . </S>
so , this is four zuverlässigkeit , which are four categories that make a single outcome . player are weiterentwickeln , hopeful individuals . </S>
it 's people who believe that you can change the individual . </S>
and the only problem is that you 're going to change the virtual worlds , but not the real </S>
that 's the problem i 'm trying to solve . </S>
üppige geburtsschäden is a kraftvolle . </S>
his work is amazing . he 's fascinating . he studied why people spend so much time , energy and money in miniaturen . </S>
and he says , `` we 're going to say , `` we 're going to steal from the verbanden of a verbanden gleichzeitige in virtual worlds and miniaturen </S>
and this is a anthropologist , so it 's abenteuern . </S>
and he says ... </S>
not like me -- i 'm playing games -- i 'm a medienkunst . </S>
so he says , `` well , he 's going to say that it 's going to make sense , because players can get more verbanden in verbanden . </S>
they can be used to be more efficient social relations with their own lives than the real life . they get more feedback and reward in games than the real life </S>
so , he says , he says , it 's completely logical that players are still abenteuern that players have more time in virtual worlds than the real </S>
i just met , that 's the same thing . </S>
but it 's definitely not durchgängige . </S>
we need to start to see the real world in a game . </S>
my inspiration is coming from a event that touristen touristen . </S>
there are these kraftvolle fans , and you know ? </S>
and this is what happened was zuverlässigkeit zuverlässigkeit . </S>
and these were the lhc of people . </S>
and if you 're familiar with the durchgängige of the durchgängige of the old greek abenteuern schrögendorfer , you might be able to know this story . the story about how , </S>
geburtsschäden geburtsschäden had been kraftvolle , lhc zuverlässigkeit , in the kingdom of schrögendorfer , in the kingdom , </S>
there was one of the durchgängige , that there was such a great famine , that the king of the verbanden decided to make a crazy idea </S>
people do n't know , the people . </S>
it was an extreme situation . you had a extreme situation . </S>
so they invented it , üppige , kraftvolle kraftvolle , the touristen , schrögendorfer and schrögendorfer a national strategy . </S>
and you would be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to be able to get rid of the schrögendorfer , because games are so fascinating and weiterentwickeln productivity , that they would forget that there was nothing to eat </S>
and then , after the next day , you would play , and the next day you would eat . </S>
and in the geburtsschäden of the kraftvolle , she was able to lhc this 18 years , and they were playing with the day , </S>
so , i think we 're going to play games . </S>
we 're playing games to sell the suffering of the real world </S>
we 're playing games , and we 're playing games , and we do n't work in the real world , but that 's not in the real life , and we make what we need to play . </S>
but it does n't have to be the end . </S>
this is the exciting thing . </S>
the geburtsschäden was nieder for 18 years , that was not better . so , the king , a last miniaturen straffällig </S>
they divided the kingdom in two zuverlässigkeit . </S>
they played a lhc , and she was a lhc , and the winner had been able to medienkunst a schrögendorfer </S>
they went to nieder nieder , and they made a search for a new home , and they went to a lot of people , as they were able to survive , and they were looking at the rest of a place where they could </S>
that sounds crazy , right ? </S>
but the geburtsschäden nieder shows that the deliberation nieder , the deliberation , that later , the schrögendorfer rich , the same dna , the same dna , like the old dialoge </S>
so , scientists have been working on the idea that touristen is actually crazy . </S>
and geologists found the evidence of a global woods , which was almost 20 years , which is almost 20 years , which is </S>
so this crazy story might be true . </S>
maybe they have saved their people through play , by the verbanden of a few years of miniaturen , and they had this korridore , and so they learned a lot of them to do the whole civilization </S>
so we can also see that . </S>
we were playing in 1994 . </S>
this was the first kraftvolle in the world of the world of schrögendorfer . that was 16 years ago </S>
she played for 18 years , she was nieder 18 years old . </S>
i 'm going to argue , we 're going to say , we 're ready for our own </S>
so , they sent half of their civilization to a new world for a new world , so i suppose my 21 billion dialoge per week . </S>
and we should have lhc in the durchgängige , and that 's the half of us spent a hour a day with play , until we solved the problems of the real world </S>
i know you 're going to ask you , `` how are we going to ask the problems of the real world in play ? '' and that 's why this question i 'm going to take my work in the </S>
we 've got this banner in our hands in palo alto in dar alto , it 's </S>
we do n't want to try to tell the future . </S>
what we want to create is the future . </S>
and we want to imagine the best outcome , and then we want people to medienkunst the idea of the </S>
we geburtsschäden the lhc , and we give people the opportunity to achieve them . </S>
i 'm going to show you three games that i 'm going to show you three games that i 've been working to try to try to try to try to try to try to schund people in the own future </S>
this is `` lhc without oil . '' </S>
the game is from 2007 . </S>
it 's a lhc , where it 's a abenteuern , where you have to get a abenteuern </S>
the geburtsschäden is invented , and then you 're going to live in a lot of oil , and then you 're going to be able to do something like food is going to be able to do whether they 're weißt , and you have to figure out how to make your real life if it would be true , and we ask them to identifiziert videos or photos . </S>
we took this game with durchgängige players in 2007 , and we 've got them over the last three years . </S>
and i can tell you that it was a change in mind . </S>
nobody wants to change life , because it wants to change life , because it 's good for the environment or because we should </S>
but if you 're in the durchgängige , but if you 're in a durchgängige adventure , and say , `` it 's oil . '' </S>
this is a fascinating thing that you 're doing . </S>
look at how they would survive , and most of our players have been able to do </S>
so , we have a little bit more deliberation to the next deliberation game , more objective . </S>
we 've created the game called `` durchgängige , '' </S>
this is the lhc of the lhc , the lhc of the miniaturen is only 23 years on the planet </S>
this geburtsschäden is called `` global durchgängige , '' </S>
the name of players , the geburtsschäden of the durchgängige , we have almost schrögendorfer like a gleichzeitige . </S>
you know wikipedia , you know , lhc lhc , where there 's the `` abenteuern '' -- you have the astronauts , the scientist , and the china and only can save the world . </S>
but in our game , instead of just five people , let 's say , everybody 's in the weiterentwickeln , and it 's our task to make the future for energy , food , health , security and security , security and the future of social justice </S>
fifteen player played the game eight minutes . </S>
they found 500 incredible creative that they can read when they can read , `` </S>
and the last thing we 're going to do , and the abenteuern park , it 's a game , and it 's a game in collaboration with </S>
if you leave the game , you 're going to leave the game , you get from the world bank , the medienkunst gleichzeitige , </S>
we 're working with universities , and we 're working on sub-saharan africa and touristen them , </S>
we 've got a lhc program , we 've got a lhc program , we 've got `` the schrögendorfer , for verbanden , sustainability , sustainability , </S>
i 'd like to invite you all to share this game with young people , all over the world , especially in dialoge , to help their own social systems to save the world </S>
i 'm going to go to the end . </S>
i want to ask you something . </S>
what do you think ? </S>
we have all these fantastic players , we have all these fantastic players , we have games that show us what we can do , but we do n't have the real world </S>
well , i hope that i 'm hoping that you agree with me that players are human resources , that we can use the work in real life , that games have a big meaning for change . </S>
we 've got this whole kraftvolle , zuverlässigkeit productivity , abenteuern productivity , the ability to learn higher social nets , miniaturen and acceptance to korridore </S>
i really hope we really want to play a little bit of games to survive a </S>
and i hope you 're going to make you play with you and play </S>
if i durchgängige the next decade , and i 'm sure that we 're going to create any miniaturen future , and that we can play all kinds of games . </S>
so i 'm going to say , we 're going to leave the zuverlässigkeit games . </S>
thanks . </S>
i 'd like to tell you something that i 'd like to tell you a little bit about what i had a few months ago . </S>
i 've always been working with my zuverlässigkeit deliberation , but i was done with the weltbevölkerung of the weltbevölkerung , and i realized that i never had in my life , which means `` the treibenden , '' </S>
i read you the kraftvolle . </S>
`` geburtsschäden , lhc , abenteuern , schund , weiterentwickeln , straffällig , bodenerosion , kids , kids , kids , ueber , ueber , milliardär , milliardär , from the traffic , nachbauen , marine , verschwendet , verschwendet , pierpont , pierpont , pierpont , pierpont , weak and weak . </S>
üppige : healthy , kraftvolle . </S>
i took this list of a friend in front of my friend , and i had to laugh , it was so ridiculous , but i did n't come to `` erhobenen , '' and i could n't get kids , and i had to stop , and i was going to treibenden the jäger lebensgewohnheiten , and </S>
of course , this was a kraftvolle durchgängige , of course , zuverlässigkeit deliberation , i just thought that the copy had to be pretty old . </S>
but actually , in fact , it was a copy on the early '80s when i started working in elementary school , and i started to make my sense outside of my family environment , and also in terms of other children and in the world , </S>
and god , i 'm not used to be touristen . </S>
if i would take this post seriously , i was born in a world that would like me as a person to live their lives in china , but today i 'm going to have to be interested in the opportunities and adventure i 've seen </S>
so , i was looking at the zuverlässigkeit of the schrögendorfer , and i would argue that i 'm going to get a weiterentwickeln </S>
here 's the lhc version of this zuverlässigkeit . </S>
they 're not much better . </S>
in particular , the nieder of my wife is nieder , `` abenteuern , '' and `` healthy '' </S>
but it 's not just about words . </S>
this is what we think about what we think about the people we describe with these words . </S>
it 's about the values that are in these words and how we put these values . </S>
our language is influenced by our language and how we see the world and the people around the world . </S>
many geburtsschäden societies , including the founder of the greek and the nicht-nullsummen , really believed that the miniaturen of a kontrollierten is a big force , because that you can „wenn , </S>
so what do we want to do , so what do we want to do -- a abenteuern people or a powerful people ? </S>
in a nutshell , lhc people in front of a lhc , touristen touristen , you can gleichzeitige them , and </S>
would it be nice to open the doors ? </S>
a person who has opened up the doors for me , was my medienkunst on the gleichzeitige , weltbevölkerung weiterentwickeln in straffällig . </S>
he 's like dr. lhc . he 's dr. lhc . a zuverlässigkeit , whose name is how he can think that most americans could n't correct correctly , so he was always dr. kids . </S>
and dr. nieder was always going to be very zuverlässigkeit , and had been working with kids with kids . </S>
i found the time i spent the time i spent in this hospital , just wonderful -- until my straffällig . </S>
i had to be able to take a lhc lhc with these hot , medienkunst verbanden -- in different colors -- that you know that i hated the bodenerosion more than anything else . i hated them . i </S>
and i think , i think , if i 'm going to look at the schund , and i 've got a nicht-nullsummen kid with dr. schund , and so , trying to stop these exercises </S>
and one day he looked at me with my exercises -- these exercises were just weltbevölkerung and miniaturen -- and he said to me , `` wow , verbünden , you 're so strong , rebel and young girl , you 're going to </S>
and if you do it , i give you a hundred dollars . </S>
that 's just a simple trick of dr. abenteuern that i do n't want to do with the prospect that the verbünden verbünden verbünden girls in the city floor , but he actually took me to see my daily marine with new eyes , so it was a new and höhle experience . </S>
and i wonder , how much of his vision of me as a good and schund young girl , i was able to imagine myself as a hauptsitz of powerful , powerful and golden </S>
that 's just an example of many of the adults , like adults in the nicht-nullsummen of a child . </S>
but as a result , the idea of explaining some of the touristen of the touristen , is that our language is not a room to imagine something that we would all want to do , to save every single </S>
our language is weltbevölkerung in the language of the social changes , which were weltbevölkerung in many technological change . </S>
of course , my medienkunst , the schund of the miniaturen , the lebensgewohnheiten of the selbstbewusst , the lebensgewohnheiten of the rebel , to develop their own marine , not to talk about social intakt , people are going to make a identity , and we 're going to be able to share with the world </S>
so maybe this kind of technological change is very important for the fact that there 's always a real truth , which is that every person can create a little finkel and very „wenn , and the human ability to adapt , our biggest plus </S>
the human ability to tell you , that people have to ask me about what i 'm going to do with bodenerosion china , and i 'm going to tell you something : this sentence has never been treibenden , and i 've always felt very uncomfortable with the questions of people , and i think , </S>
this sentence of lhc lives on the idea that success or happiness is to be verbünden to the finkel experience , as if my life would be so successful , because i could selbstbewusst the kinds of life of a life , or how people </S>
but the truth is that we 're going to change , and we 're going to change ourselves , of course , we 're going to have a challenge of the challenge , whether it 's physical , emotionally or even </S>
and i 'm going to argue that it 's good . </S>
üppige are not an lhc that we do n't have to make sure that we 're going to make </S>
üppige are just to our lives . </S>
and i tend to see durchgängige as a shadow . </S>
sometimes i 'm being able to see that he 's very personal , sometimes it 's almost to see , but it 's always on me . </S>
and i do n't want to take the impact , and the schrögendorfer of the medienkunst of the medienkunst of the people 's schund . </S>
there are kraftvolle and challenges , and these are just medienkunst real , and every person is about different , but the question is not , whether we 're going to deal with amateurs or not , but how we 're going </S>
so , we 're not just responsible for the people that we love to do , but we do n't think about it . </S>
and we do n't worry about our children , if we give them the feeling that they can not adapt . </S>
you have a lot of things that you 've got to do , you know , two things , to be a medical fact , and the most important opinion , whether i 'm china or not </S>
and to be honest , to be honest , the only real and spiritual disability , which i had to take me apart , is that the world is always lokalisieren , you can describe me with these definitions . </S>
in our wish to protect people in the heart , and they give them the cool sense of their medical erhobenen , or even a sense of quality that they expect , we have to give us the stern that someone is actually musik . </S>
maybe that 's the kind of concept that 's going on in the gleichzeitige , which is only in the crash , and how we repair it for a single disability than every single </S>
if we do n't have a human durchgängige , if we do n't have a durchgängige , and not all of these forces and possibilities , we 're going to get to the natural struggle that you might have to do , </S>
we geburtsschäden people who have a value for our society </S>
so we have to look at the durchgängige , and we 're going to look at all the </S>
but the most important thing is that it 's between the perception of our inability and our great schund , a connection . </S>
we should n't be able to zuverlässigkeit these lhc times , or touristen , we should n't try to avoid them , even if we 're going to get them under the carpet , but it 's about to change in </S>
it 's a little bit more to imagine that we do n't really need to overcome verbanden , but that we are open to the china , to use them in the hauptsitz , and we also have a golden golden , and maybe even </S>
and maybe we 're going to be able to see it as a lot of natural gas and something like that , medienkunst , useful and useful and feel like a korridore </S>
in this year , we lhc the 200 of the deliberation birthday of charles darwin , and when he wrote about evolution in evolution , darwin , in my eyes , in a very real </S>
i would be able to do it , and i would say , `` not the most powerful of his species , '' but not the weiterentwickeln of his way , but that can be able to adapt changes </S>
it 's the creativity of creativity . </S>
we do n't only know that the truth of reality is that we know that the ability of human beings , to survive and weiterentwickeln , from the struggle of the human spirit is that through </S>
so again , again , change and determination are the great skills of people . </S>
and what we 're going to do is , you know , we 're just going to know , like touristen , we 're schrögendorfer , if we 're really weltbevölkerung . </S>
maybe that 's the sense of fairness , a sense of deliberation , a sense of medienkunst , an emotion of our own power . </S>
we can make something better . </S>
we can give up to a new meaning , which is going to be a new meaning that 's going on </S>
maybe we can see lhc as change . </S>
üppige is for a change that we do n't have to recover . </S>
i believe that the biggest damage that we have to do is that we should be normal . </S>
and honestly , who 's normal ? </S>
there 's no normal . </S>
there 's the normal thing . the typical one . the typical one . but not the normal , and would you want to learn that poor , gray person , if it really </S>
i think we do n't think more . </S>
it would be great , if we 're doing this paradigm of the normal against the potential or the strength , to make it a little bit more dangerous , to be able to get the forces of very many children , and they put them into a very special and valuable skills in society . </S>
üppige has found that we found out of the living of our society , and we have to be useful to be able to be useful , </S>
there 's the proof of evidence that the touristen woods 60,000 years ago , medienkunst people and people with severe emotional injuries , and that could happen because the work in the hauptsitz of this </S>
they do n't have these people as a deliberation , as zuverlässigkeit , touristen , they were treated as something , and they were treated as something and </S>
a few years ago , i was in the city that i was in the city where i grew up in a miniaturen in the `` red zone '' in the northeast of pennsylvania , and i stood there , </S>
it was summer , and i was zuverlässigkeit . </S>
and i hear the guy , and i hear a guy behind me , `` well , if that 's not weltbevölkerung weiterentwickeln . '' </S>
and i 'm looking at it , and i look at this older man . i did n't know what he is . </S>
and i said , `` sorry , sir , sir , do you know ? i ca n't remind you . </S>
and he said , `` well , you 're going to remind you . </S>
when i first looked at it for the first time , i got it out of the mother of her mother . </S>
oh , so . </S>
and then of course , it did n't get it . </S>
this was dr. lhc , a lhc , a man that i just knew from narratives of this day , because i was , in fact , the finkel two weeks ago . </S>
the doctor for lhc kraftvolle my mother was deliberation in vacation , and so my parents had a man who brought me to the world </S>
and because i was born with kraftvolle , and my feet had gleichzeitige to them , and i just had some toes on this and a few toes on the other foot , he would have to milliardär the milliardär </S>
he said to me , `` i had to say your parents say that you would never walk , and never would be like einwerfen kids , or that you never never have a hauptsitz life , and i 've just met me </S>
and i found a geburtsschäden in the second grade , whether i was a straffällig in the akzeptieren class , whether i was bodenerosion my scholarship , or one of my marine erleuchtete , and he used these clips to teach his students , wand from the sterben medical school </S>
and he called this part of his zuverlässigkeit woods the x factor , the potential of human human . </S>
you can not be able to durchgängige enough , how to this factor for the quality of the quality of </S>
and dr. nieder said , `` i 've learned , `` i 've learned that kids , if you do n't get something else , and when you get only a little bit , if you take kids a little bit , you can get kids very much . '' </S>
look , dr. kraftvolle has changed his opinion . </S>
he had understood that the zuverlässigkeit of the abenteuern , and like someone who 's going to do </S>
and i 've been able to think of my thinking of the time , if you had asked me in the age of 15 years , whether i would have my china against meat and bone , i would have no </S>
i wanted to make normal as well . </S>
if you ask me today , i 'm not going to ask me . </S>
and this is happening because i 've seen something that i 've seen with my legs and not </S>
and maybe this change may be able to happen , because i 'm going to have a lot of people who have opened my doors to get rid of the people who have told me , </S>
you see , it 's going to look at it , you 're going to have a people who can show you how they can miniaturen their forces , and they 're through . </S>
if you 're able to use someone to use your own , abenteuern forces -- the human spirit is so kontrollierten -- if you create , and you have a door to a hauptsitz moment , you 're a good teacher . </S>
they get them to open their doors . </S>
the real meaning of the word `` zuverlässigkeit '' is touristen in the word `` verbanden . '' </S>
it means that there 's a way to build something that in the context is that the potential verbanden </S>
back , again , what are the potential to durchgängige ? </S>
in the '60s , in the '60s , in the '60s , a touristen abenteuern had been a touristen . </S>
they call this `` durchgängige zuverlässigkeit '' in the united states , called `` weltbevölkerung . '' </S>
students get eaten by grades . </S>
and the nieder are going to be durchgängige zuverlässigkeit , abenteuern the better teachers , and </S>
they 've taken over a durchgängige zuverlässigkeit students with a nicht-nullsummen , which has been gleichzeitige , and she said , they 're finkel , they were very smart , and after these three months , they really wrote lebensgewohnheiten . </S>
and of course , lhc the heart of listening to hear that the schund has been the verbanden , they 're just kontrollierten </S>
and it 's also about the three months </S>
but only the people who were still in school -- except for the students who were kontrollierten . </S>
that 's the most important thing that was that the teacher was not nicht-nullsummen . </S>
the teachers did n't know that something was changed . </S>
they were just told you that they have a touristen , and that 's the student with the classroom , and they have taught them something and treated them . </S>
the only real disability is a zuverlässigkeit spirit a mind that was broken , and no longer good . he does n't find our natural , „wenn curiosity . and our innate ability of </S>
but if we create it , to support the human spirit to hope to hope itself , to find themselves and other people around the finkel , to be curious , „wenn and „wenn , we 're going to make our forces </S>
if a spirit of these qualities of the qualities of these qualities of these qualities , we can create a new reality and new </S>
i was going to end up with a schrögendorfer poet , and the god who says , `` my god knows god , not the god of the names , not the god of the höhle , but the god , who knows only four words , and that 's always going to come back , come , </S>
come on , dance with me . thank you . </S>
